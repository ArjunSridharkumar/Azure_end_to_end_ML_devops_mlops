NCT00302692,Use of Beta Blockers in Elderly Trauma Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00302692,UNKNOWN,"Advances in medical care have increased the proportion of elderly Americans and enabled them to remain more physically active. This has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the number of geriatric patients admitted to trauma centers. The elderly constitute 23% of trauma center admissions, but 36% of all trauma deaths. This disproportionately high mortality is attributable to a higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions, particularly, cardiac disease. Multi-system injuries result in critical cardiac stress. Although beta-blockade has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients at risk for myocardial infarction after elective surgery, their use in trauma patients with potential underlying cardiac disease has not been previously studied. We hypothesize that routine administration of beta-blockers after resuscitation will reduce morbidity and mortality in elderly trauma patients with, or at risk for, underlying cardiac disease.This study is a randomized, prospective clinical trial. One cohort will receive routine trauma intensive care, and the other, the same care plus beta-blockade after completion of resuscitation. The primary outcome will be mortality. Secondary outcomes include MI, length of stay, organ dysfunction, cardiac, and other complications.Changes in outcome may not be due to reduction in myocardial oxygen demand and heart rate. Laboratory studies demonstrate that circulating inflammatory cytokines contribute to cardiac risk in trauma patients, and their production is influenced by adrenergic stimulation. We will measure circulating IL-6, TNF alpha, IL-1beta, and measure NF-kB and p38 MAP kinase activation in peripheral blood leukocytes, and determine the effect of beta-blockade on the production of these inflammatory markers.Finally, the wide variation in patient response to beta-blockers is attributed to genetic variability in the adrenergic receptor. Therefore, we will identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) within the beta-adrenergic receptor, and determine their effects on mortality and response to beta-blockade. This study will provide the first randomized, prospective trial designed to reduce morbidity and mortality in elderly trauma patients at risk for cardiac disease. The laboratory and genetic component will provide additional insights that may explain treatment effects, lead to new therapeutic strategies, and have the potential to lead to additional areas of investigation.",NO,Multiple Trauma|Cardiovascular Diseases|Aged,DRUG: Esmolol|DRUG: Metoprolol,Mortality|Cardiovascular Morbidity,Inflammatory Profile,,University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,American Heart Association,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,148,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,AHA 0465044Y,2005-12,,2008-09,2006-03-14,,2007-05-10,"Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Texas, 75235, United States",

NCT03277365,MyGeneRank: A Digital Platform for Next-Generation Genetic Studies,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03277365,RECRUITING,"Many conditions affecting health are caused by a combination of environment, behaviors, and genes. While individuals can alter some factors in their lives to reduce the chances of developing different diseases (e.g., not smoking cigarettes), the contribution from genetic risk encoded by DNA remains with people throughout their lives. Scientists are still trying to determine the entirety of genetic factors that influence disease, but for some conditions it has been shown that the factors identified thus far can begin to identify people at high to low genetic risk. Looking across the genome, scientists can calculate a cumulative genetic risk score - which can be used to rank genetic risk compared to other worldwide populations.The goal of this study is to determine how genetic risk influences health decisions and other things that can be controlled in life. The first genetic risk score is calculated for coronary heart disease (CAD). CAD ultimately leads to heart attacks, heart failure and sometimes sudden cardiac death and is the main reason heart disease remains as the number one cause of death worldwide. Other researchers have shown that this genetic risk score can be used to identify people with low, intermediate, and high risk for coronary heart disease. It has also been shown that the use of statins (cholesterol lowering drugs) provides greater benefit and protection against heart attack for people with high genetic risk for coronary artery disease.Leveraging the Apple ResearchKit and the ResearchKit linked 23andMe API, customers of 23andMe are able to provide researchers access to their genomic data. Participants will use the ResearchKit app to provide consent, view study information, answer surveys, and contact the study team.Participants will be asked to complete 3 surveys.

NCT05459974,Use of Colchicine to Decrease Atrial Fibrillation Recurrence After Ablation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05459974,UNKNOWN,"Ablation of atrial fibrillation (AFib) has been recommended as a therapeutic option when rhythm maintenance strategy is sought. One of the main objectives of an AFib ablation procedure is electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins, which have been identified as common triggering sites of the arrhythmia. The pathophysiology of AFib is not fully elucidated. Inflammation seems to play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of AFib. Previous studies have shown that inflammatory markers reactivity (eg, C-reactive protein \[CRP\] complex levels, elevation of white blood cells) are increased in patients who develop AFib. Similarly, recurrence of AFib within the first few weeks after ablation procedure seems to be mediated by an inflammatory process triggered by the ablation per se as implied by increased early CRP levels in AFib ablation patients. On the other hand, AFib can further induce and maintain a cascade of inflammatory events leading to electrical and structural atrial remodeling which leads to higher incidence of Afib development. Many trials have investigated the role of anti-inflammatory agents in preventing post-ablation AFib, using various treatment regimens such as corticosteroid therapy, antiarrhythmic medications like amiodarone, intravenous magnesium, atorvastatin, and colchicine. Previous studies have shown that colchicine can lead to decreased recurrence of post-ablation AFib with a beneficial impact in self-perceived quality of life of the patients. There is limited knowledge regarding the impact of colchicine duration and dosing on post-ablation Afib recurrence and the self-perceived quality of life.

These particles are involved in causing blood vessel diseases that can lead to conditions like atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) or heart attack. Participants will undergo accepted medical tests and procedures to evaluate their condition. Most of the test results are helpful in making a diagnosis and in guiding treatment.People with lipid disorders are eligible for this study.

Apolipoproteins (plasma proteins involved in metabolism of cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and proteins in the blood) and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism are measured.* Fat biopsy. A small sample of fat tissue is collected for examination. For this test, an area on the buttock or abdominal wall is numbed. A needle is inserted into the fat, and a small amount of tissue is sucked out by a syringe.* Leukapheresis. White blood cells are collected to help diagnose the lipid disorder. For this test, blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components, and the white cells are removed. The rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the same needle or through another needle in the other arm.* Skin biopsy. Skin cells are collected for study. The cells are grown in the laboratory and the amount of cholesterol that enters or leaves the cells is measured, providing information on abnormalities in cholesterol transport.

Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a powerful new modality for the non-invasive detection of provocable coronary ischemia in patients with low to intermediate-risk chest pain or its equivalent. Intermountain Medical Center (IMC) is performing approximately 6000 clinical cardiac PET scans annually. However, cardiac PET scans are expensive (i.e., billed at \>$5,000/scan, average receivable revenue $1500-$2000/scan). Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a sensitive marker of coronary atherosclerosis. A CAC scan (CACS), performed by multislice computed tomography (CT), is a relatively inexpensive (\~$70-$150/scan), low-radiation dose test that marks the presence of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. The absence of CAC has been shown to be associated with very low coronary risk. ACCURATE will test whether a CAC-first strategy (i.e., risk stratification, when CAC ≤ 1, to medical management or to cardiac PET stress testing), performed routinely in symptomatic patients presenting for evaluation of possible coronary artery disease (CAD) prior to the cardiac PET stress test, can be used as a gatekeeper for progression to the expensive rubidium-PET stress (regadenoson) perfusion scan and be a major cost-saver without adversely affecting patient care or outcomes. Routinely, qualifying patients undergo CACS when they present for evaluation of possible but unknown CAD status and are referred for cardiac PET stress testing. In ACCURATE, those with CACS≤1 will then be consented and randomized to either a cardiac PET stress test strategy or a non-PET-driven medical care strategy. Subjects randomized to the cardiac PET stress test strategy will receive appropriate subsequent care depending on the outcome of the cardiac PET scan (i.e., depending on whether ischemia is present or not). Subjects randomized to the CAC-only arm will receive appropriate non-PET driven medical clinical management and follow-up. All participating subjects' electronic medical records will be reviewed indefinitely for clinical outcomes. Initial outcomes will be reported at 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years, with future analyses to be determined by the study investigators.The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that PET stress test strategy will results in a decreasing in major adverse cardiac endpoint without exceeding $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year compared to a CAC-first strategy for screening suspected/possible coronary artery disease.",NO,Coronary Artery Disease,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PET Stress Test|OTHER: Non-PET Medical Management,"Non-inferior major adverse cardiac endpoint (MACE) outcomes, Routine cardiac PET stress test strategy will result in significantly fewer major adverse cardiac endpoint (MACE) outcomes (defined as coronary death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or ischemia driven revascularization) at 1 year compared with a a CAC-first strategy., 1 year|Cost-effectiveness, The costs of routine cardiac PET stress test strategy will be less than \<$100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared to CAC-first strategy.

NCT00001529,Improved Methods of Cell Selection for Bone Marrow Transplant Alternatives,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00001529,RECRUITING,"Bone marrow transplants (BMT) are one form of treatment for disorders of the blood, including leukemia. However, because the procedure is often associated with potentially life-threatening reactions, it is usually reserved for patients with serious illnesses under the age of 60 years old.One serious reaction complicating bone marrow transplants is referred to as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a potentially fatal incompatibility reaction. The reaction is caused by antigens found on the cells of the patient that are not present on the cells of the donor. The antigens are recognized by transplanted white blood cells (lymphocytes). These lymphocytes begin attacking the recipient s cells and tissues and may lead to death.In order to avoid GVHD, researchers have developed a technique using peripheral blood instead of bone marrow that allows transplantation of stem cells and removal of lymphocytes. Stem cells are the cells responsible for returning blood cell production to normal. Lymphocytes are the white blood cells that can cause GVHD.The technique requires two steps. In the first step blood cells are collected from donors who have received doses of a growth factor. The growth factor (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) is designed to increase the production of donor stem cells.In the second step white blood cell lymphocytes are removed from the collected blood, leaving only the stem cells.The main goal of this study is to develop and improve the method of processing cells that are collected after stimulation with growth factor (G-CSF), by removing the white blood cell lymphocytes which can cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) while keeping the stem cells necessary for healthy blood cell building.

NCT02107976,"Famine From Feast: Linking Vitamin C, Red Blood Cell Fragility, and Diabetes",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02107976,RECRUITING,"Diabetes type two is a debilitating disease that leads to chronic morbidity such as accelerated microvascular disease. Accelerated microvascular disease may produce blindness, end stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and limb ischemia. Strategies to prevent or delay microvascular disease have the potential to improve the lives of millions and prevent catastrophic illness. The major focus of prevention of microvascular disease in diabetes has been on the endothelium and its role in protection of blood vessels. An unexpected means to prevent microvascular disease in diabetes may be coupled to the function of vitamin C in red blood cells (RBCs) of diabetic subjects. Based on new and emerging data, vitamin C concentrations in RBCs may be inversely related to glucose concentrations found in diabetes. Based on animal data, we hypothesize that RBCs with low vitamin C levels may have decreased deformability, leading to slower flow in capillaries and microvascular hypoxia, the hallmark of diabetic microangiopathy. Low vitamin C concentrations in RBCs of diabetic subjects may be able to be increased, by using vitamin C supplements. Findings in animals may not accurately reflect effects in humans because of species differences in mechanisms of vitamin C entry into RBCs. Therefore, clinical research is essential to characterize vitamin C physiology in RBCs of diabetic subjects. In this protocol we will investigate physiology of vitamin C in RBCs of diabetic subjects as a function of glycemia, without vitamin C supplementation (stage 1) and with vitamin C supplementation (stage 2). We will screen type II diabetic subjects on insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic medication(s) and select those with hemoglobin A1C concentrations of less than or equal to 12%. Selected subjects may be hospitalized twice, each time for approximately one week. The primary objective of the first hospitalization (stage 1) will be to evaluate the effect of hyperglycemia on vitamin C RBC physiology regardless of baseline vitamin C concentrations (without any vitamin C supplementation). The second hospitalization (stage 2) investigates the effect (if any) of vitamin C supplementation to changes in RBC physiology during euglycemic and hyperglycemic states. As inpatients, subjects will have two venous sampling periods each of approximately 24 hours. On admission, subjects may be fitted with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), oral hypoglycemic agents will be discontinued, and basal-bolus insulin regimen initiated. Insulin doses will be clinically determined and titrated to achieve euglycemia (fasting and pre-meal glucoses \<140mg/dl) prior to the first sampling period (euglycemic sampling). The first sampling period will be performed under conditions of euglycemic control for 24 hours. The second sampling period will be performed under controlled hyperglycemia induced by withholding basal and bolus insulin and providing a high carbohydrate load diet (70-75% carbohydrate). Correction-scale insulin will be provided for glucoses \>350-400mg/dl. Hyperglycemia will not exceed 9 hours, and will be reversed by reinstituting insulin.During the two sampling periods, samples will be withdrawn via venous catheter for RBC deformability, vitamin C concentrations and other related research studies. Following completion of stage 1, subjects considered for participation in stage 2 will be provided a prescription for vitamin C 500mg twice daily. Given that vitamin C and vitamin E are related antioxidants, and that both vitamins appear to be associated with RBC rigidity, diabetic subjects may also be given a prescription for 400 international units (IU) of vitamin E (RRR alpha tocopherol) daily. Subjects will continue vitamin C and E supplementation for a minimum of 8 weeks depending on RBC vitamin C concentrations. To evaluate any effect of vitamin E supplementation, plasma and RBC vitamin E levels may be measured concurrently with vitamin C levels during various phases of stages 1 and 2. All subjects will be seen as outpatients at biweekly or monthly intervals with regular measurement of plasma and RBC vitamin C concentrations. Target RBC vitamin C concentration \>30uM is required prior to stage 2 inpatient sampling studies. Vitamins C and E supplementation will be discontinued upon inpatient admission for stage 2. Risk of both vitamin supplements are minimal as both supplementation doses are safe. Outcomes are to measure RBC rigidity and vitamin concentrations before and after supplementation. After a minimum of 8 weeks (depending on RBC vitamin C levels), subjects will be hospitalized again, and sampling repeated as described. In this manner, each subject serves as his/her own control, and deformability of red blood cells can be determined in relation to glycemia and to vitamin C concentrations in RBCs and plasma.",NO,Diabetes Type 2,DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Vitamin E|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Vitamin C,"Change in RBC deformability half maximal shear stress (SS0.5) from stage 1 to stage 2, RBC SS0.5 is another measure of RBC deformability hypothesized to increase after dietary vitamin C and vitamin E supplmentation in diabetic subjects., End of stage 2|Change in RBC deformability maximum elongation indices (EImax) from stage 1 to stage2, RBC EImax is hypothesized to increase in people with diabetes following vitamin C and vitamin E dietary supplementation., End of stage 2|Change in RBC deformability elongation indices (EI) from stage 1 to stage 2, Red blood cell (RBC) deformability measures the ability of the RBC to change shape upon entering into capillaries.

NCT04272060,Ultra-high-resolution CT vs. Conventional Angiography for Detecting Coronary Heart Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04272060,RECRUITING,"Cardiac catheterization with invasive coronary angiography is the gold standard for determining the presence or absence of significant coronary heart disease (CHD). However, cardiac catheterization is costly and, as an invasive procedure, it is associated with some risk of adverse events, rarely even stroke, myocardial infarction, or death. Recent advances in multi-detector computed tomography angiography (CTA) have allowed rapid, noninvasive coronary artery imaging in patients with suspected CHD. CTA generally yields high accuracy for identifying patients with CHD when compared to cardiac catheterization. However, diagnostic accuracy is reduced in the setting of severe coronary artery calcification and coronary stents due to its inferior spatial resolution compared to cardiac catheterization. Because high-risk patients often have severe coronary calcification or stents, the application of CTA has been particularly limited in this important patient group. Recently, an ultrahigh-resolution CT scanner was released which has shown promise to overcome the limitation of conventional CTA in the setting of severe coronary artery calcification or stents. This ultrahigh-resolution ""precision"" CT scanner (UHR-CT) contains detector rows with half the width than currently available systems (0.25 mm vs. 0.5 mm) resulting in approximately twice the spatial resolution.The purpose of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that high-resolution CTA is not inferior to the current standard of cardiac catheterization for identifying significant CHD in patients with high-risk characteristics, including severe coronary artery calcification and coronary stents.The investigators propose to enroll 50 patients over 24-30 months in this investigation as part of a multicenter study. Patients referred for cardiac catheterization with known CHD and suspected obstructive coronary artery stenosis will be included.

NCT04075162,Community Benefit of No-charge Calcium Score Screening Program,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04075162,RECRUITING,"Current approaches in primary prevention for cardiovascular disease are based on probabilistic approaches to estimate risk, using many of the widely available cardiovascular risks scores, with over 100 such scoring systems currently available throughout the world. The rationale for this practice is to select those individuals at greatest risk for more intense targets, reduce risk of treatment to those at minimal risk, and to maximize the cost-effectiveness of treatment. A recent Cochrane Systematic Review assessed the practice of using risk scores to select individuals for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. 3 The principal finding of the systematic review was that there was little or no effect of providing clinicians with cardiovascular risk scores when compared to standard of care (5.4% versus 5.3%; relative risk 1.01, 95% confidence intervals 0.95 to 1.08). The authors concluded that there is major uncertainty whether current strategies for providing risk scores and called for further research to address this concern. Extent of coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a strong risk marker for coronary events, with evidence mainly derived from observational studies and from prospective non-randomized studies. CAC, although endorsed for intermediate risk patients, is not widely adopted due to barriers in reimbursement. The cost of the test ranges between 100 and 300 USD in the United States, which may have limited the wide adoption of the test. Whether reducing the cost burden for CAC increases utilization for routine screening and its influence on physician practices and downstream testing is largely unknown. University Hospitals started offering low charge CAC (99$) since 2014. In 2017, University Hospitals started offering CAC for no charge for patients to improve access to this test, which has not traditionally been covered by insurance companies.

NCT05616260,Acetazolamide for Obstructive Sleep Apnea to Improve Heart Health,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05616260,RECRUITING,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a severe type of snoring causing people to choke in their sleep. It affects millions of Americans, causing many health problems. For example, patients with OSA often feel very sleepy and are at risk of falling asleep while driving. OSA also causes elevated blood pressure increasing the risk for heart attacks and strokes. Patients with OSA are often treated with a face-mask that helps them breath at night but can be difficult to tolerate. In fact, about half the patients eventually stop using this mask. Because there are few other treatments (and no drug therapy), many OSA patients are still untreated. Of note, especially young adults (i.e. 18 to 50 years old) benefit from treating their OSA, but they are also less likely to use the mask.Acetazolamide (a mild diuretic drug) has been used for over 50 years to treat many different conditions and is well tolerated. Recent data suggest, that acetazolamide may help OSA patients to not choke in their sleep and lower their blood pressure. Especially young adults with OSA are likely to respond well to this drug. Further, its low cost (66¢/day) and once- daily dosing may be particularly attractive for young OSA patients unable or unwilling to wear a mask each night. But previous studies had many limitations and did not focus on young adults. The goal of this study is to test if acetazolamide can improve sleep apnea and cardiovascular health in young adults with OSA (18-50 years old), and how it does that. Thus, we will treat 46 young OSA patients with acetazolamide or placebo for 2 weeks each. The order in which participants receive the drug or placebo will be randomized.

Heart and blood vessel CT scans can cause high radiation exposure. Different methods of creating CT pictures have been developed to reduce the radiation dose. Researchers want to see how effective these new methods are in producing accurate CT scans.Objectives:- To study new ways of taking pictures of the heart or blood vessels using computed tomography.Eligibility:- Adults at least 18 years of age who will be having imaging studies to help detect heart or blood vessel problems.Design:* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples will be taken to check kidney function.* Participants will have a CT scan of the heart and blood vessels. A contrast agent may be used to improve the quality of the images. The scanning session may last up to 2 hours.* Timing of and the need for follow up contact will depend on results from the initial scan and may be repeated to assess for late events.

Propranolol is a drug that is classified as a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers affect the heart and circulation (blood flow through arteries and veins). Cancer patients may be under a tremendous amount of stress with elevated levels of norepinephrine (a hormone produced by the adrenal glands in response to stress). Increased adrenergic stress may dampen the immune system, which beta-blockers, like propranolol, may be able to counteract. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in the standard chemotherapy regimen, mFOLFOX (leucovorin, fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

NCT06343376,Genetically Engineered Cells (EGFRt/19-28z/IL-12 CAR T Cells) for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory CD19+ Hematologic Malignancies,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06343376,RECRUITING,"This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of genetically engineered cells called EGFRt/19-28z/IL-12 CAR T cells, and to see how they work in treating patients with hematologic malignancies that makes a protein called CD19 (CD19-positive) that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell Therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. To improve the effectiveness of the modified T cells and to help the immune system fight cancer cells better, the modified T cells given in this study will include a gene that makes the T cells produce a cytokine (a molecule involved in signaling within the immune system) called interleukin-12 (IL-12). The researchers think that IL-12 may improve the effectiveness of the modified T cells, and it may also strengthen the immune system to fight cancer.

It uses lower energy levels than other MRI scanners. This may help scan people with metal devices in their body, or in invasive heart procedures using metal tools.Objective:To test a new MRI scanner and software changes to create better pictures.Eligibility:People with disease and healthy volunteers, ages 18 and older.Design:Participants will be screened with blood tests.Participants may have both the new MRI and a conventional MRI or only the new one. If 2 are done, they must be within 60 days.For both MRI versions, participants lie on a table that slides into a large tube. During scans, they will hold their breath for up to 20 seconds at a time. Heart activity will be measured by wires connected to pads on the skin. A flexible belt may be used to monitor their breathing. They will be in the scanner up to 2 hours.Participants can agree to have a dye called gadolinium injected into their arm during the scan.

Clopidogrel resistance means that blood platelets show little or no response to clopidogrel. It is closely associated with increased risk of serious cardiovascular events, seriously affects the prognosis of patients, and brings difficulties to clinical treatment.Guideline recommendations on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy have been formulated that ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus aspirin in preference to clopidogrel 75mg daily plus aspirin for ACS patients. Recent study found that ticagrelor 90mg twice a day orally could significantly reduce the occurrence of clopidogrel resistance and adverse cardiovascular events. The previous studies have reported that half-dose ticagrelor had the similar inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation as the standard-dose ticagrelor, which was significantly stronger than that in the clopidogrel group. But it is still not very clear that the effect of low-dose ticagrelor on platelet function in patients with clopidogrel resistance and coronary heart disease.Therefore, we performed this randomized, single-blind clinical trial to observe the effects of low-dose ticagrelor and double standard-dose clopidogrel on platelet aggregation and prognosis in clopidogrel resistance's patients with coronary heart disease.",NO,"Coronary Artery Disease|Clopidogrel, Poor Metabolism of",DRUG: Clopidogrel|DRUG: ticagrelor,"The platelet aggregation rate, Light transmission aggregometry method, up to 7 days","Side effects including bleeding,dyspnea and arrhythmia, up to 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months|Adverse events including myocardial infarction, death, stroke, re-hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases and ischemia events, up to 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months",,First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2|PHASE3,80,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,SCAD-20170220,2017-02-10,2019-07-31,2019-12-31,2017-02-23,,2018-05-07,"whole blood lumi-aggregometer type 560 VS, Havertown, Pennsylvania, 19083, United States",

NCT05980130,Can Rumination-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Reduce the Risk of Cardio-vascular Disease?,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05980130,RECRUITING,"Many people know that a poor diet, exercise, smoking, and alcohol use cause heart disease. However, a less known factor that increases the risk of heart disease is depression. In addition, heart disease can also make depression worse. Almost half of American adults have some form of heart disease. Patients with low income are at an even greater risk. The circular relation between depression and heart disease raises the question of whether or not there are factors that lead to both. Attacking a factor that affects both depression and heart disease could help prevent them both. One such factor is rumination which is when someone tends to have repeated negative thoughts that loop without end. This loop in turn tears and wears down the body over time, making the person be at risk for heart disease and depression. Rumination-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (RFCBT) is a tool that targets rumination and, by doing so, reduces the risk for depression. While research has shown RFCBT helps to reduce or stop the loop that leads to depression, this project will further look at the effect of RFCBT on measures of heart health persons with low income.",NO,Rumination|Depressive Symptoms|Blood Pressure,BEHAVIORAL: Rumination-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy,"Response Style Questionnaire, sadness rumination, Score range: 5-20, higher score =

NCT03707626,Collateral Circulation to LAD and Wellens Sign,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03707626,UNKNOWN,"Overall Aim Coronary artery disease significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality in the United States. Atherosclerotic disease can lead to stenosis of the coronary arteries and subsequent cardiac hypoperfusion. Patients with a critical stenosis of the LAD, potentially leading to acute anterior wall myocardial infarction, may be asymptomatic at presentation with subtle EKG changes as its only manifestation. It is imperative for physicians to recognize patients with new T wave inversions in leads V2-V3 as the standard course of management may lead to poor prognosis.The purpose of this study is to determine if collateral circulation to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery will mask the presence of a Wellens sign and therefore diminish its diagnostic utility. The conclusion of this study would raise awareness for physicians in light of an absent Wellens sign.Hypothesis The presence of coronary collateral circulation to the LAD masks the presence of a Wellens sign (both Type 1 and Type 2) in precordial leads V2-V4.",NO,"Coronary Artery Disease|Acute Myocardial Infarction|Acute Myocardial Infarction of Anterior Wall|Collateral Circulation, Any Site",OTHER: Wellens Sign,"Wellens Sign, 2003-2016",,,"Coney Island Hospital, Brooklyn, NY",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,1500,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,18-08-283-378(HHC),2018-09-26,2019-06-23,2019-06-23,2018-10-16,,2018-10-16,"Coney Island Hospital, Brooklyn, New York, 11235, United States",

NCT04335630,Cardiovascular Manifestations of COVID-19,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04335630,UNKNOWN,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The first reports of COVID-19 came from Wuhan, China in December of 2019. Since then, the disease has spread rapidly around the globe, accounting for thousands of deaths in multiple countries. On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Although COVID-19 manifests primarily as a respiratory illness, several cardiovascular implications have been reported related to its natural course and treatment. Its exact effect on the cardiovascular system though is currently unknown. Therefore, we propose a retrospective, observational, case-control study looking for cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19, including laboratory evidence of myocardial injury, electrocardiographic changes, arrhythmias and echocardiographic abnormalities. Hospitalized patients admitted with fever, cough, sore throat, and/or dyspnea who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 will be included in our study and will be matched based on their age and gender with patients admitted with similar symptoms who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The electronic medical charts of the study subjects will be reviewed and relevant demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings will be deidentified and recorded. Since our study will be a retrospective chart review study it carries minimal risk for the patients and the investigators. Cardiovascular disease associated with COVID-19 might be contributing to the high mortality rates and its recognition will allow for prevention, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

NCT00857155,Time Based Strategy to Reduce Clopidogrel Associated Bleeding Related to Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00857155,UNKNOWN,"Purpose: In patients with coronary artery disease, aspirin and Plavix are used increasingly to prevent the formation of blood clots in the coronary arteries. These drugs exert their beneficial effects by irreversibly blocking platelets, the compounds found in blood responsible for clotting after an injury or during a heart attack. However, these effects also place patients at increased risk for bleeding after coronary artery bypass surgery. Therefore, it is currently recommended to withhold Plavix therapy for 5 days before undergoing surgery in order to reduce the incidence of bleeding. However, it has been repeatedly shown that Plavix exerts variable effects on different patients, which may be partially explained by poor absorption, drug-drug interaction, and by variations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which constitutes your genes. In addition, the time required for platelets to regain function after Plavix treatment has been shown to vary between patients. Therefore, by measuring platelet function, it may be possible to determine the optimal amount of time required to withhold Plavix before undergoing bypass surgery, which may improve rates of bleeding following the procedure. The purpose of this study is to classify patients into groups based on platelet function in order to define the ideal time period for delaying surgery. By analyzing the amount of time required for platelet recovery, it is expected that surgery-related bleeding will decrease without increasing the risk of blood clot formation.Eligibility: Approximately 200 patients requiring CABG will be enrolled at Sinai Hospital, which is the only site where this study is being conducted.To be eligible you must:* Be able to provide written informed consent.* Be between the ages of 18-85 and require CABG.* Currently be on aspirin therapy (81-325mg).",NO,Coronary Artery Disease,OTHER: Clopidogrel withdraw prior to CABG,"The primary endpoint is chest tube drainage., During the index hospitalization","The secondary endpoint is transfusion requirements., Index hospitalization",,LifeBridge Health,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,200,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,IRB# 1464,2009-01,2011-01,2011-02,2009-03-06,,2009-03-06,"Sinai Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, 21215, United States",

NCT04634240,Staged Complete Revascularization for Coronary Artery Disease vs Medical Management Alone in Patients With AS Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04634240,RECRUITING,"Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) often have concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) which may adversely affect prognosis. There is uncertainty about the benefits and the optimal timing of revascularization for such patients. There is currently clinical equipoise regarding the management of concomitant CAD in patients undergoing TAVR. Some centers perform routine revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (either before or after TAVR), while others follow an alternative strategy of medical management.The potential benefits and optimal timing of PCI in these patients are unknown. As TAVR expands to lower risk patients, and potentially becomes the preferred therapy for the majority of patients with severe aortic stenosis, the optimal management of concomitant coronary artery disease will be of increasing importance.The COMPLETE TAVR study will determine whether, on a background of guideline-directed medical therapy, a strategy of complete revascularization involving staged PCI using drug eluting stents to treat all suitable coronary artery lesions is superior to a strategy of medical therapy alone in reducing the composite outcome of Cardiovascular Death, new Myocardial Infarction, Ischemia-driven Revascularization or Hospitalization for Unstable Angina or Heart Failure.The study will be a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial with blinded adjudication of outcomes. Patients will be screened and consented for elective transfemoral TAVR and randomized within 96 hours of successful balloon expandable TAVR.Complete Revascularization:Staged PCI using third generation drug eluting stents to treat all suitable coronary artery lesions in vessels that are at least 2.5 mm in diameter and that are amenable to treatment with PCI and have a ≥70% visual angiographic diameter stenosis. Staged PCI can occur any time from 1 to 45 days post successful transfemoral TAVR.Vs. Medical Therapy Alone:No further revascularization of coronary artery lesions.All patients, regardless of randomized treatment allocation, will receive guideline-directed medical therapy consisting of risk factor modification and use of evidence-based therapies. The COMPLETE TAVR study will help address the current lack of evidence in this area. It will likely impact both the global delivery of health care and the management and clinical outcomes of all patients undergoing TAVR with concomitant CAD.",NO,Aortic Stenosis|Coronary Artery Disease|Coronary Stenosis,PROCEDURE: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI),"Composite of Cardiovascular Death or New Myocardial Infarction or Ischemia-Driven Revascularization or Hospitalization for Unstable Angina or Heart Failure, Median follow-up of 3.5 years","Cardiovascular Death or New Myocardial Infarction, Deaths will be classified as cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular.

It happens when the immune system starts to attack the bone marrow cells. This causes the bone marrow to stop making red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells. Standard treatment for this disease is horse-ATG and cyclosporine, which suppress the immune system and stop it from attacking the bone marrow. However, this treatment does not work in all people. Some people still have poor blood cell counts even after treatment.* Eltrombopag is a drug designed to mimic a protein in the body called thrombopoietin. It helps the body to make more platelets. It may also cause the body to make more red and white blood cells. Studies have shown that eltrombopag may be useful when added to standard treatment for severe aplastic anemia. It may help improve poor blood cell counts.Objectives:- To test the safety and effectiveness of adding eltrombopag to standard immunosuppressive therapy for severe aplastic anemia.Eligibility:- Individuals at least 2 years of age who have severe aplastic anemia that has not yet been treated.Design:* Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood tests.

NCT03026101,Understanding the Pathophysiology of Migraine Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03026101,RECRUITING,"Migraine is the most common headache disorder, prevalent in 18% of females and 6% of males. Emergency room visits, physician consults, hospitalizations, medications, and indirect costs such as lost work days and decreased productivity place the global economic burden of migraines at over 20 billion dollars. It is prevalent in 28 million people in the US alone. Symptoms include unilateral, throbbing, debilitating headache pain accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. Upwards of 75% of migraine patients have reduced functionability, have lost time at work, and 1/3 of patients require bed rest to manage the symptoms. The health-related impact on quality of life was comparable with that experienced by patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or diabetes.While the burden of migraines on our society is clear, the pathophysiology of migraines remains largely unknown. The trigeminovascular system, including the external and internal carotid arteries and their associated sensory fibers which subserve the head have long been implicated in the pain and cutaneous allodynia experienced by migraine patients. Wolff in 1953, was the first to posit that migraine headache pain is the caused by dilation or circumferential expansion of the extracranial carotid artery. He demonstrated that migraineurs had twice the pulse amplitude in their external carotid arteries compared to control subjects and these changes were directly correlated to migraine symptoms. In a 2008 study, randomized migraineurs received nitroglycerin via peripheral IV or placebo for 20 minutes prior to obtaining magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).

Radiation therapy uses high energy radiation or protons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Cisplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Carboplatin is also in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

It is also known as broken heart syndrome, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, stress cardiomyopathy and apical ballooning cardiomyopathy, among other names. The pathogenesis of this disorder is not well understood. Possible mechanisms include catecholamine excess, coronary artery spasm, microvascular dysfunction, among others. This is a multicenter, nation-wide, observational study of patients who were previously diagnosed with takotsubo syndrome. The investigators aim to use this registry to help plan and carry out further studies and to improve understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of this syndrome.

NCT04188522,Imaging Post-Stroke Recovery: Using MEG to Evaluate Cognition,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04188522,RECRUITING,"This is a study using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to look at recovery in those with minor stroke. The investigators know that these individuals report difficulties in attention, concentration, multi-tasking, energy level, and processing speed that appear to be independent of lesion size or location. The underlying pathophysiology is unclear; however, anecdotally, many individuals are significantly improved by 6 months post-stroke. One hypothesis is that a single lesion, regardless of size, may disrupt the classic neural networks required for cognitive function. The investigators are currently collecting data to better characterize these difficulties and stroke patients' recovery as part of a previously approved recovery study. In this sub-study, the investigators propose to add MEG at 1 and 6 months in a subset of individuals with small: 1) subcortical, and 2) cortical lesions. The investigators will partner with colleagues at the University of Maryland (College Park), who are well experienced with MEG to conduct this research.

Educating patients about the disease is important for them to be able to understand the condition better, feel empowered and take an active part in their care plan. AI technology can potentially be used to impart such education. However, doing so with care and empathy is equally important.Therefore, it is necessary to ensure when AI technology is used to impart education about atrial fibrillation to patients, the humane aspects of the interaction are rigorously tested. This study examines a way to impart atrial fibrillation education through interaction with an AI chatbot, that uses text and links to educational videos. To participate in this study, people need to be age 18 or older and have a history of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. Approximately 40 individuals will be asked to take part in this study.The first step to the study will be reading through, understanding, and signing an informed consent. People who then agree to join the study will have a one-time interaction with the AI chatbot and structured educational material by using an iPad provided to them for the approximately 1 hour duration of the study. People in the study will obtain atrial fibrillation education by typing one by one on the iPad, up to 10 questions about the disease. Answers will include text and links to videos.

This is known as the study medicine. Which treatment participants get is decided by chance. Participants chance of getting ziltivekimab or placebo is the same.Ziltivekimab is not yet approved in any country or region in the world. It is a new medicine doctors cannot prescribe.Participants will get the study medicine in a pre filled syringe. Participants will need to use the pre filled syringe to inject the study medicine into a skinfold once-monthly.The study is expected to last for up to 4 years. Participants will have up to 20 clinic visits.

NCT03981835,Management of Antiplatelet Regimen During Surgical Procedures,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03981835,RECRUITING,"There are key differences today in clinical practice regarding perioperative management of post-PCI patients on DAPT undergoing NCS. Moreover, there are significant differences between bridging agents, and improved safety of current-generation DES. Given the significant limitations of current studies a well-designed registry to study current U.S. practice patterns and the bleeding or ischemic risks associated with the various perioperative DAPT management strategies including bridging and no bridging will significantly add to the understanding of the current problem and associated risks of patients. These data could form the basis for conducting future randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in this area. NCS in post-PCI patients on chronic DAPT presents a complex interaction of both ischemic and bleeding risks.The MARS registry will study the area of perioperative antiplatelet therapy management through a multicenter observational national registry designed to collect pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative clinical strategies, therapeutic interventions and outcomes data. This proposal outlines the role of a highly experienced clinical trial team to conduct a multicenter prospective registry. This question is highly relevant to a diverse group of medical providers and millions of patients in the US and around the world; this will be the first such U.S. registry to address this critically important public health issue.Study objectives:i. To collect data on contemporary clinical practice in the U.S. on managing post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) DAPT in patients scheduled to undergo NCS and CS.ii.

NCT06236139,Cell Therapy (STEAP1 CART) With Enzalutamide for the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06236139,RECRUITING,"This phase I/II trial tests the safety and effectiveness of cell therapy (STEAP1 CART) with enzalutamide in treating patients with prostate cancer that continues to grow despite surgical or medical treatments to block androgen production (castration-resistant) and that has spread from where it first started (the prostate) to other places in the body (metastatic). Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men. Localized prostate cancer is often curable and even metastatic disease may respond to treatment for a few years. Despite multiple therapies, including hormone therapy and chemotherapy, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) still remains an incurable disease. Recently, adoptive cellular immunotherapies have been developed to transfer immunogenic cells to the patient to produce an anti-tumor response. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CART)-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T-cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack tumor cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's tumor cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Prostate stem cell antigen and prostate specific membrane antigen CAR T cell therapies have been shown to be safe and effective, but objective tumor responses remain rare. STEAP1 is an antigen that promotes cancer growth and spread and is found to be broadly expressed in mCRPC tissues. STEAP1 CART is CAR T cells that have been engineered with a STEAP1 antigen to better target prostate tumor cells. Enzalutamide is in a class of medications called androgen receptor inhibitors. It works by blocking the effects of androgen (a male reproductive hormone) to stop the growth and spread of cancer cells.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Treatment for PMBCL involves chemotherapy combined with an immunotherapy called rituximab. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells.

NCT04101539,Comparing Pulmonary Vein Isolation to Pulmonary Vein Isolation + OPTIMA Ablation in Patients Undergoing Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04101539,RECRUITING,"Catheter ablation is an established cornerstone of therapy for patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) who wish to avoid anti-arrhythmic drug therapy or for whom anti-arrhythmics have proven ineffective. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), in which circumferential ablation is performed around the ostia of the pulmonary vein - left atrial junctions, is the standard ablation approach internationally. Single-procedure success rates (1y, freedom from AF, off anti-arrhythmics) for patients with paroxysmal AF is roughly 70%, and even worse (roughly 50%) for patients with persistent AF.A number of strategies have been developed to improve outcomes in patients undergoing AF ablation, particularly in patients with persistent AF. Unfortunately, large prospective randomized trials (including STAR-AF II, published in NEJM in 2015) have demonstrated a failure of ancillary ablation techniques to improve AF ablation outcomes relative to PVI alone.In a collaborative effort between the Cardiology electrophysiology group and the Trayanova laboratory (Biomechanical Engineering), investigators have developed a strategy of patient-specific modeling to identify pro-arrhythmic sites in AF patients that may be amenable to ablation. In this approach, patients undergo a pre-ablation cardiac MRI with late gadolinium enhancement, to delineate regions of healthy atrial tissue and regions of scar (this scan is clinically indicated, and performed currently in patients undergoing PVI for AF). A novel in silico modeling to determine regions supporting electrical reentry in the atrium, driving ongoing AF, has been developed by the Trayanova lab. In preliminary studies, investigators have demonstrated the ability to identify and target these regions with catheter ablation in patients undergoing PVI.Investigators would like to conduct a prospective, randomized clinical trial in patients undergoing ablation for symptomatic persistent AF. All patients enrolled would undergo standard pre-procedure imaging (LGE-MRI) prior to the day of procedure. Investigators have developed methodology termed OPTIMA (OPtimal Target Identification via Modeling of Arrhythmogenesis) to determine, based on non-invasive patient-specific anatomic and tissue data from late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MRI (LGE-CMR) and simulation of cardiac electrical function, personalized ablation targets for persistent AF in patients with fibrotic remodeling.. Patients would be randomized to receiving PVI only versus PVI + OPTIMA ablation at the time of ablation. Patients would then be followed in standard clinical fashion at 3m, 6m, and 12m to assess for ablation efficacy and for procedural complications.Investigators postulate a 20% improvement in freedom from AF with PVI + OPTIMA ablation form 50% to 70% (compared to PVI alone), investigators anticipate that in 1:1 randomization, a sample size of 80 patients in each arm will yield a power calculation of 80% with an alpha of 0.05.

This may provide opportunities for novel diagnostic tests as well as a potential for therapeutic intervention. The link between gut microbiota and the severity of heart attacks may also lead to novel therapeutic approaches (probiotics, non-absorbable antibiotics) to prevent heart attacks from happening. The studies proposed will test the hypothesis that altered intestinal microbiota are mechanistically linked to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The investigator's objective is to determine whether inflammatory markers in the blood are decreased and endothelial cell function improved by a probiotic in patients with established coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the investigators wish to elucidate a mechanism by which the gut microbiota regulates serum inflammatory markers.1. Specific Aim 1 will determine the impact of a probiotic on circulating leptin and TMAO levels, conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, oxidized LDL, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, fibrinogen and adiponectin, glucose-dependent- insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like-peptide (GLP-1), glucagon, insulin), and their relationship to the intestinal microbiota (15 representative microbial groups) as non conventional risk factors. Several blood samples will be collected to measure biomarkers. Participants will provide periodic stool samples in order to measure gut bacterial biodiversity. Lastly, endothelial cell function (flow mediated dilation) will be measured in order to assess blood vessel function.2. Specific Aim 2 will determine the impact of a probiotic on metabolites derived from the intestinal microbiota as candidates for non-conventional risk factors of cardiovascular disease. The relationship between metabolites derived from the intestinal microbiota, endothelial cell function and risk factors for cardiovascular disease identified in Specific Aim 1 will be correlated.",NO,"Cardiovascular Disease|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Goodbelly first|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Placebo first,"change in baseline flow mediated dilation (FMD) at 6 weeks, This is a measurement of endothelial function in the brachial artery, baseline and week 6",,,Medical College of Wisconsin,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,215,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE",PRO27955,2018-05-15,2025-09-05,2025-11-30,2017-08-30,,2024-03-12,"Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53226, United States",

NCT06003569,Reducing Asthma Attacks in Disadvantaged School Children With Asthma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06003569,RECRUITING,"Our UH3 clinical trial, ""Reducing Asthma Attacks in Disadvantaged School Children with Asthma,"" seeks broad-scale implementation of our effective school-based approach to improve asthma disparities for children, ages 5-12 years, in low-income communities. The investigators will contextualize dissemination and implementation (D\&I) of our Colorado school-based asthma program (Col-SBAP) that reduces asthma exacerbations and missed school days, while also addressing social determinants of health. Our Better Asthma Control for Kids (BACK) Program will evaluate key metrics identified by diverse stakeholders during this dissemination trial in rural and small metropolitan areas of Colorado. Our clinical trial includes two implementation strategies: our standard Col-SBAP, titled BACK-Standard (BACK-S) and an enhanced community-centered approach, titled Back-Enhanced (BACK-E). These two strategies are designed for sustainable delivery by school asthma navigators and school nurses who coordinate with primary care and community resources. The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) D\&I framework was applied with community partners during the UG3 planning phase to tailor implementation plans that meet local community needs, resources and priorities (EPIS Phases 1 \& 2). BACK-S and BACK-E will be delivered from years 1-3 with data collection for implementation and effectiveness outcomes in 4 Colorado regions. In year 4, the investigators will collect data for sustainment outcomes (EPIS phase 3). The investigators will apply the work from EPIS phases 1-3 to refine our ""dissemination playbook"" that guides adoption by other school systems (EPIS Phase 4). Our primary implementation hypothesis is: Reach will be greater among students when delivered using the BACK-E arm as compared to BACK-S. Our effectiveness hypothesis is: BACK will be more effective than usual care at reducing asthma exacerbations. The BACK playbook includes training materials and a calculation of return on investment.

NCT05675410,"A Study to Compare Standard Therapy to Treat Hodgkin Lymphoma to the Use of Two Drugs, Brentuximab Vedotin and Nivolumab",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05675410,RECRUITING,"This phase III trial compares the effect of adding immunotherapy (brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab) to standard treatment (chemotherapy with or without radiation) to the standard treatment alone in improving survival in patients with stage I and II classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin is in a class of medications called antibody-drug conjugates. It is made of a monoclonal antibody called brentuximab that is linked to a cytotoxic agent called vedotin. Brentuximab attaches to CD30 positive lymphoma cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine sulfate, dacarbazine, and procarbazine hydrochloride work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Vincristine is in a class of medications called vinca alkaloids. It works by stopping cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Adding immunotherapy to the standard treatment of chemotherapy with or without radiation may increase survival and/or fewer short-term or long-term side effects in patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma compared to the standard treatment alone.",NO,Lugano Classification Limited Stage Hodgkin Lymphoma AJCC v8,PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|BIOLOGICAL: Bleomycin Sulfate|DRUG: Brentuximab Vedotin|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Dacarbazine|DRUG: Doxorubicin Hydrochloride|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Etoposide Phosphate|OTHER: Fludeoxyglucose F-18|RADIATION: Involved-site Radiation Therapy|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography|DRUG: Prednisolone|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Procarbazine Hydrochloride|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|DRUG: Vinblastine Sulfate|DRUG: Vincristine Sulfate,"Progression-free survival (PFS) in rapid early responder (RER) patients, Will compare the PFS of RER patients randomized to immunotherapy (IO) therapy (brentuximab vedotin \[Bv\]-nivolumab \[Nivo\]) against those randomized to standard therapy.

NCT06364423,Anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Immunotherapy for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06364423,RECRUITING,"Background:Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are blood cancers that affect certain white blood cells. Advanced forms of these diseases are difficult to treat. CD19 is a protein often found on the surfaces of these cancer cells. Researchers can modify a person's own immune cells (T cells) to target CD19. When these modified T cells are returned to the body-a treatment called anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy-they may help kill cancer cells.Objective:To test anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in people with CLL or SLL.Eligibility:People aged 18 years and older with CLL or SLL that has not been controlled with standard drugs.Design:Participants will be screened. They will have imaging scans and tests of their heart function. If a sample of tissue from their tumor is not available, a new one may be taken; the sample will be tested for CD19.Participants will receive a drug to reduce the leukemia cells in their blood. Then they will undergo apheresis: Blood will be taken from the body through a needle. The blood will pass through a machine that separates out the T cells. The remaining blood will be returned to the body through a different needle. The collected T cells will be gene edited to make them attack cells with CD19.Participants will take drugs to prepare them for treatment for 3 days. These drugs will start 5 days before the treatment. Then their own modified CAR T cells will be returned to their bloodstream. Participants will stay in the hospital for at least 9 days after the treatment.Follow-up visits will continue for 5 years.",NO,"B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell|B-Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chronic",BIOLOGICAL: Autologous HuCD19 ( Anti-CD19)CAR T cells|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Rituximab,"Phase I: Determine the safety of administering T-cells expressing a fully-human anti-CD19 CAR to participants with advanced CLL or SLL., Adverse Events (AE) by type, grade, and frequency, From time of the pre-leukapheresis rituximab through 5 years after CAR T infusion.|Phase II: Determine the overall response rate (ORR) of T cells expressing an anti-CD19 CAR with a fully-human single chain variable fragment (scFv) to participants with advanced CLL, Overall Response Rate will be evaluated using published criteria; these will be reported along with a 95% confidence interval, From time of the pre-leukapheresis rituximab through 5 years after CAR T infusion.","Phase I: Assess overall response rate, Overall Response rate (ORR= CR + PR) will be recorded if ORR occurs at any response assessment time-point., up to 5 years|Phase I+II: Assess complete response rate, Complete Response rate (CR) in participants who receive subsequent infusion, up to 5 years after entry date for last participant, up to 5 years|Phase I+II: Assess duration of responses, Duration of response from date of response will be measured for no more than 5 years after the last participant has been enrolled on the trial., up to 5 years|Phase I+II: Determine the ORR for re treatment with rituximab, chemotherapy and CAR T cells in eligible patients, Overall Response rate (ORR= CR + PR) for re-treatment with Rituximab will be recorded if ORR occurs at any response assessment time-point., up to 5 years|Phase II: Determine the frequency of grade 3-4 adverse events at the Optimal Dose, Adverse Events (AE) by type, grade, and frequency, up to 5 years",,National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,66,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,10001599|001599-C,2024-09-03,2029-07-01,2030-07-01,2024-04-15,,2025-01-16,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",

It will 1) establish a registry of patients with cerebrovascular disease (stroke); 2) characterize the natural history of acute stroke and transient ischemic attacks (TIA)-an interruption of blood flow to the brain that causes stroke symptoms for a short period of time); and 3) evaluate the data to generate ideas for future studies.Patients 18 years of age or older with suspected acute stroke or TIA may be eligible for this study. Subjects will be recruited from patients who present with stroke at the emergency department of Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.The study will gather data collected from diagnostic and laboratory tests the patient undergoes as part of standard medical care, including findings of medical and neurological examinations and other tests. In addition, studies will be done for research purposes only to gather data about stroke and TIA. These may include the following:* Blood and urine tests not more than 2 tablespoons of blood will be drawn for various tests.* Electrocardiogram (EKG) (heart tracing)-electrodes placed on the chest wall detect the heartbeat and heart rhythm.* Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head-specialized X-rays are used to obtain images of the brain.* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain-a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce images that provide information about the brain tissue and blood vessels.* Transcranial Doppler (TCD)-sound waves are used to image the arteries of the brain and neck.* Echocardiogram-sound waves are used to image the heart and evaluate heart function.Patients may be asked to return to Suburban Hospital for follow-up testing in 1, 3, and/or 12 months, when some of these tests may be repeated to assess changes over time...",NO,"Brain Disease|Ischemic Attack, Transient|Cerebrovascular Accident|Cerebrovascular Disorder|Vascular Diseases",,"Prevalence and type of abnormalities seen on neuroimaging as a function of time from acute insult, Neuroimaging abnormalities, such as:-Imaging positive for acute ischemic cerebral vascular syndrome ( AICS positive )-Presence of a lesion on diffusion, perfusion, and mismatch between the two-Evidence of a vascular occlusion on MR angiography-Evidence of a thrombus or hemorrhage on T2\* GRE imaging-Blood-brain barrier disruption as evidence by ""HARM""-The evolution of these markers with time and treatment, Post-acute, 24 hours, 5 days/discharge, 30 days","Stroke severity as measured by NIHSS as a function of time since index event, Post-acute, 24 hours, 5 days/discharge, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months|Clinical outcome measured using modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index, 5 days/discharge, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months|Gene expression profiles and biomarker levels obtained from blood samples, Post-acute, 24 hours, 5 days/discharge, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months",,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,3000,NIH,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,010007|01-N-0007,2001-01-26,,,2001-01-25,,2025-02-04,"Medstar Washington Hospital Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20010, United States|Suburban Hospital - Johns Hopkins Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland, 20814, United States|National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",

NCT03783117,Magneto-rheology to Lower Blood Pressure,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03783117,UNKNOWN,"Heart attacks and strokes are the leading causes of death in US. High blood viscosity and turbulence in blood flow are the key for cardiovascular diseases. Recent research has shown that application of a strong magnetic field along the blood flow direction will polarize the red blood cells and align them into short chains along the flow, so that the blood viscosity in the flow direction is reduced significantly and disturbed motions in the directions perpendicular to the flow is suppressed. This makes the blood flow laminar, turbulence suppressed, and the possibility of cardiac events reduced. Such magnet treatment also cures rouleaux and improves the blood's oxygen function. The lab tests also confirm that the above effects last more than 24 hours after one treatment.The purpose of this trial is to apply this technology to humans. According to the lab tests, this magnetic treatment has the potential to bring the following benefits to the subjects: (a)The blood viscosity will be reduced by 10-20% or more. (b) The turbulence in blood circulation will be suppressed by the treatment. After the treatment, the blood flow will be laminar. As a joint effect of viscosity reduction and turbulence suppression, the blood pressure will be lowered by 10-20% or more. (c) The subject's blood oxygen function will be improved by the treatment. Especially, if the subject has rouleaux in his/her blood, the effect will be significant. (d) The above effects will last for about 24 hours after one treatment and slowly decay; however, re-treatment will bring the effects back. (e) Because steady laminar blood flow is atheroprotective by active reduction of inflammatory genes, the magnetic treatment, reducing disturbed blood flow hemodynamics, would be possible to have a long term effect as an anti-atherogenic therapy if the treatment keeps for a while.The investigators have just completed the pilot clinical trial. The tests confirm that the technology is safe and effective in lowering the blood pressure and the effect lasts about 24 hours. The present pivotal clinical trials are the continuation and expansion of the pilot tests. The successful clinical trials will make this technology available for people in preventing heart attack and stroke.",NO,Hypertension,DEVICE: Magnetic field treatment,"Change of Blood Pressure at the End of Magnetic Treatment, Measure and evaluate the change of both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure from the baseline at the end of magnetic treatment., Through study completion, an average of 1 year","Change of Blood Pressure 24 Hours after the Magnetic Treatment, Measure and evaluate the change of both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure from the baseline 24 hours after the magnetic treatment, Through study completion, an average of 1 year",,Cardiovascular Therapy LLC,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,200,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,201801,2018-08-10,2019-08-09,2019-08-31,2018-12-20,,2018-12-20,"Magnetic Blood Pressure Lowering Device Study, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19122, United States",

The identification of such genes, and examination of their structure and function, will enable a delineation of molecular pathogenesis and, ultimately, prevention or treatment of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. There are many different possible modes of inheritance for congenital anomalies, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and multifactorial. Multi-factorial inheritance is responsible for many common medical disorders, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, diabetes and cancer. This type of inheritance pattern appears to involve environmental factors as well as a combination of genetic variations that together can predispose to or produce congenital anomalies, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia.Our study is designed to establish a small, well-defined genetic resource consisting of 1) Nuclear families suitable for linkage analysis by parametric,non-parametric (e.g. sib pairs, TDT) and association techniques, 2) Individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia who can be directly screened for allelic variation in candidate genes, and 3) Individuals who can serve as controls (are unaffected by congenital diaphragmatic hernia). Neonates and their families will be collected from homogenous and heterogeneous populations. By characterizing diverse populations, it should be possible to increase the likelihood of demonstration of genetic variation in selected candidate genes that can then be used in association and linkage studies in individual subjects with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.",NO,Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia,,"Percentage of patients with a genetic diagnosis, DNA samples from patients will be analyzed for underlying genetic causes., 5 years","Developmental outcomes at 2 and 5 years of age, Formal Developmental outcome measures, 1 exam at 2 year and 1 exam at 5 years|Percentage of patients with pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary hypertension measured by echocardiogram, 5 years",,Columbia University,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)|National Institutes of Health (NIH),ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,3000,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,AAAB2063|R01HD057036,2005-06,2025-11,2025-11,2009-07-31,,2024-05-01,"Rush Hospital, Chicago, Illinois, United States|University of Michigan/ CS Mott Children's Hospital, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48167-5245, United States|Washington University Medical Center/ St. Louis Children's Hospital, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Children's Hospital of Omaha/ University of Nebraska, Omaha, Nebraska, 68114, United States|Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York, 11030, United States|Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York- Presbyterian (Columbia University Medical Center), New York, New York, 10032, United States|New York University, Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU Langone Health, New York, New York, United States|Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Medical Center/ University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45229, United States|Oregon Health & Science University, Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Portland, Oregon, 97239, United States|Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh/ University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States|Monroe Carrell Jr Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee, 37232, United States|UT Southwestern Medical Center, Children's Health, Dallas, Dallas, Texas, 75235, United States|Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53226, United States|Cairo University Hospital, Cairo, Egypt",

NCT05521399,Heart Transplantation - Renewal,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05521399,RECRUITING,"Heart transplantation (HTx) is a well-established life-saving procedure but is associated with severe complications. Regular monitoring of heart transplant recipients is thus important for the early detection of these complications. Current standard clinical tests, however, rely on frequent invasive procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography (Cath). In addition, these standard tests are limited by sampling error, the diffuse nature of HTx complications, and high health care utilization cost, estimated at \>$150,000 per year per patient in the US. To address these limitations, our group has developed a non-invasive multiparametric cardiac MRI, which can quantify abnormal changes in heart tissue and function. Our efforts during the initial period of this study (NIH funded 2014-2019) have focused on the two major complications of HTx: 1) acute cardiac rejection (ACR), the leading cause of death in the first year after heart transplant; and 2) cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), the greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality beyond the first year after heart transplantation. For these major compilation, our previous cardiac MRI studies have identified new non-invasive cardiac MRI measures that can detect abnormalities of heart tissue and function.

Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

Clopidogrel is an oral antiplatelet agent that has been shown to prevent strokes and heart attacks. Atorvastatin is a cholesterol lowering agent.Twenty adults 18-75 years of age requiring cholesterol-lowering agent and antiplatelet agent therapy will be recruited for this study during their cardiology clinic visitation. In one group, antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel) regimen will be administered first, then followed by cholesterol-lowering medication (atorvastatin). In the second group, atorvastatin will be administered first, followed by clopidogrel.A new test called the erythromycin breath test will be administered to you three times during the study to measure how your liver will metabolize these drugs. Blood samples will also be obtained to assess platelet function.

NCT02415803,Safety and Efficacy of Low-Dose Ticagrelor in Chinese Patients With NSTE-ACS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02415803,UNKNOWN,"Ticagrelor is an oral, reversibly-binding, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist used clinically for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Guideline recommendations on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) have been formulated that ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus aspirin in preference to clopidogrel 75mg daily plus aspirin for patients who have an ACS with or without ST-segment elevation. These recommendations are primarily based on large, randomized, Phase III clinical trials. However, few East Asian patients (or those of East Asian descent) have been included in these trials to assess the use of these drugs. In addition, a growing body of data supported that East Asian might have different adverse event profiles (thrombophilia and bleeding) and ""therapeutic window"" compared with white subjects. Furthermore, ""East Asian paradox"" phenomenon has been described that East Asian patients have a higher prevalence of platelet reactivity during DAPT, but an ischaemic event rate following PCI or ACS is similar or even lower than white patients. Therefore, the antiplatelet treatment strategy that is most appropriate for East Asian patients is increasingly urgent. Therefore, we performed the current study to observe the different effects of low-dose ticagrelor (45 mg twice daily), conventional-dose ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) and clopidogrel (75mg once daily) on high platelet reactivity (HPR) and IPA, and investigated the safety and efficacy of low-dose ticagrelor further in Chinese patients with non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS).",NO,Non ST Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome,DRUG: low-dose ticagrelor|DRUG: conventional-dose ticagrelor|DRUG: Clopidogrel,"the differences in mean inhibition of platelet aggregation or inhibition ratio (%), After overnight fasting, venous blood samples of all subjects were taken for pharmacodynamic measurements before dosing (baseline) and 12 hours after the last dose.

NCT03949855,Belimumab With Rituximab for Primary Membranous Nephropathy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03949855,RECRUITING,"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of belimumab and intravenous rituximab co-administration at inducing a complete or partial remission (CR or PR) compared to rituximab alone in participants with primary membranous nephropathy.Background:Primary membranous nephropathy (MN) is among the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults. MN affects individuals of all ages and races. The peak incidence of MN is in the fifth decade of life.Primary MN is recognized to be an autoimmune disease, a disease where the body's own immune system causes damage to kidneys. This damage can cause the loss of too much protein in the urine.Drugs used to treat MN aim to reduce the attack by one's own immune system on the kidneys by blocking inflammation and reducing the immune system's function. These drugs can have serious side effects and often do not cure the disease. There is a need for new treatments for MN that are better at improving the disease while reducing fewer treatment associated side effects.In this study, researchers will evaluate if treatment with a combination of two different drugs, belimumab and rituximab, is effective at blocking the immune attacks on the kidney compared to rituximab alone. Rituximab works by decreasing a type of immune cell, called B cells. B cells are known to have a role in MN. Once these cells are removed, disease may become less active or even inactive. However, after stopping treatment, the body will make new B cells which may cause disease to become active again.Belimumab works by decreasing the new B cells produced by the body and, may even change the type of new B cells subsequently produced. Belimumab is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (also referred to as lupus or SLE). Rituximab is approved by the FDA to treat some types of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and vasculitis. Neither rituximab nor belimumab is approved by the FDA to treat MN.

Sometimes the donor cells attack the recipient's body, called graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide helps reduce the risk and severity of GVHD. Researchers want to learn if using a lower dose of cyclophosphamide may reduce the drug's side effects while maintaining its effectiveness. Such an approach is being used in an ongoing clinical study at the NIH with promising results, but this approach has not been tested for transplants using lower doses of chemotherapy/radiation prior to the transplant.Objective:To learn if using a lower dose of cyclophosphamide will help people have a successful transplant and have fewer problems and side effects.Eligibility:Adults ages 18-85 who have a blood cancer that did not respond well to standard treatments or is at high risk for relapse without transplant, and their donors.Design:Participants may be screened with the following:Medical historyPhysical examBlood and urine testsHeart and lung testsBody imaging scans (they may get a contrast agent)Spinal tapBone marrow biopsyParticipants will be hospitalized for 4-6 weeks. They will have a central venous catheter placed in a chest or neck vein. It will be used to give medicines, transfusions, and the donor cells, and to take blood. In the week before transplant, they will get 2 chemotherapy drugs and radiation. After the transplant, they will get the study drug for 2 days. They will take other drugs for up to 2 months.Participants must stay near NIH for 3 months after discharge for weekly study visits.

NCT05686070,"A Study to Test Asundexian for Preventing a Stroke Caused by a Clot in Participants After an Acute Ischemic Stroke or After a High-risk Transient Ischemic Attack, a So-called Mini Stroke",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05686070,RECRUITING,"Researchers are looking for a better way to prevent an ischemic stroke which occurs when a blood clot travelled to the brain in people who within the last 72 hours had:* an acute stroke due to a blood clot that formed outside the heart (acute non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke), or* TIA/mini-stroke with a high risk of turning into a stroke (high-risk transient ischemic attack), and who are planned to receive standard of care therapy. Acute ischemic strokes or TIA/mini-stroke result from a blocked or reduced blood flow to a part of the brain. They are caused by blood clots that travel to the brain and block the vessels that supply it. If these blood clots form elsewhere than in the heart, the stroke is called non-cardioembolic. People who already had a non-cardioembolic stroke are more likely to have another stroke. This is why they are treated preventively with an antiplatelet therapy, the current standard of care. Antiplatelet medicines prevent platelets, components of blood clotting, from clumping together.Anticoagulants are another type of medicine that prevents blood clots from forming by interfering with a process known as coagulation (or blood clotting).The study treatment asundexian is a new type of anticoagulant currently under development to provide further treatment options. Asundexian aims to further improve the standard of care without increasing the risk of bleeding.The main purpose of this study is to learn whether asundexian works better than placebo at reducing ischemic strokes in participants who recently had a non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA/mini-stroke when given in addition to standard antiplatelet therapy. A placebo is a treatment that looks like a medicine but does not have any medicine in it.Another aim is to compare the occurrence of major bleeding events during the study between the asundexian and the placebo group. Major bleedings have a serious or even life-threatening impact on a person's health.Dependent on the treatment group, the participants will either take asundexian or placebo once a day for at least 3 months up to 31 months.Approximately every 3 months during the treatment period, either a phone call or a visit to the study site is scheduled on an alternating basis. In addition, one visit before and up to two visits after the treatment period are planned.During the study, the study team will:* Check vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate* Examine the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)* Take blood samples* Ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatments. In addition, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire on quality of life at certain time points during the study.",NO,Prevention of Ischemic Stroke|Acute Non-cardioembolic Ischemic Stroke|High-risk Transient Ischemic Attack,DRUG: Asundexian (BAY2433334)|DRUG: Placebo,"Time to first occurrence of ischemic stroke, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of ISTH major bleeding, ISTH=International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Up to 31 months","Time to first occurrence of all strokes (ischemic and hemorrhagic), Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of composite of CV death, MI or stroke, CV=Cardiovascular, MI=Myocardial infarction, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of composite of all-cause mortality, MI or stroke, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of disabling stroke (mRS ≥3 at 90 days), mRS=Modified Rankin Scale, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of all-cause mortality, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of transient ischemic attack (TIA), Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of composite of ISTH major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of ISTH clinically relevant non-major bleeding, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of hemorrhagic stroke, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of fatal bleeding, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of minor bleeding, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of composite of ischemic stroke or ISTH major bleeding, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of composite of CV death, all stroke, MI or ISTH major bleeding, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of composite of all-cause mortality, disabling stroke, fatal bleeding, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, Up to 31 months|Time to first occurrence of ischemic stroke in the first 90 days, Up to 31 months",,Bayer,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,12300,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",20604|2023-503793-20-00|2022-001067-27,2023-01-26,2025-10-10,2025-10-10,2023-01-17,,2025-02-05,"Eastern Shore Research Institute, LLC | Fairhope, AL, Fairhope, Alabama, 36532, United States|St. Joseph's Hosp | Barrow Neuro Institute, Phoenix, Arizona, 85013, United States|HonorHealth Research Institute, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85258, United States|Banner -

NCT06287775,"Testing the Combination of an Anti-cancer Drug, Iadademstat, With Other Anti-cancer Drugs (Atezolizumab or Durvalumab) at Improving Outcomes for Small Cell Lung Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06287775,RECRUITING,"This phase I/II trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of iadademstat when given together with atezolizumab or durvalumab, and studies the effect of the combination in treating patients with small cell lung cancer that has spread outside of the lung in which it began or to other parts of the body (extensive stage) who initially received standard of care chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

Patients who survive the initial trauma are liable to secondary insults from the ensuing inflammatory state in the brain. Treatment goals are aimed at reducing secondary injury. Maintaining adequate brain perfusion, limiting cerebral edema, and optimizing oxygen delivery are part of established treatment protocols. Numerous therapeutics have been evaluated as potential treatment for TBI with very limited success and there is no medication that alters survival.Various novel therapeutic options have been investigated to prevent the secondary brain injury. Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) is one of these therapies. RIC involves decreasing blood flow to a normal tissue usually the arm by inflating the blood pressure cuff 30mmHg over the systolic blood pressure. The decreased blood flow or ischemia is maintained for 5 minutes followed by releasing the pressure and re-perfusion of the arm. This cycle is usually repeated 4 times. RIC has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with heart attacks, strokes, elective neurosurgeries.A prospective observational study and a randomized clinical trial has shown the protective effect of RIC in TBI patients. Additionally, multiple studies in animals have shown that RIC is neuroprotective after TBI. RIC is non-invasive and harmless except for a little discomfort in the arm.

NCT02582021,WISE CVD - Continuation (WISE HFpEF),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02582021,RECRUITING,"The Women's Ischemia Study Evaluation (WISE), a cohort study of over 1000 women, has made many contributions to the understanding of cardiovascular disease. A milestone acknowledged in the 2011 AHA Herrick Lecture is the role of Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction (CMD) in women with symptoms/signs of ischemia without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). While in 1996, CMD was considered ""an imaging artifact"", in 2013, it is a widely accepted as a pathophysiologic process requiring systematic cohesive scientific pursuit. CMD is prevalent, associated with adverse clinical outcomes, poor quality of life and healthcare costs rivaling obstructive CAD. There are 2-3 million US women with CMD, and 100,000 new cases projected annually placing CMD prevalence, morbidity and costs higher than all female reproductive cancers combined.Among women with ischemia, preserved ejection fraction and no obstructive CAD, it has been observed that there are relatively more new onset heart failure (HF) hospitalizations than nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). It has been hypothesized that CMD contributes to left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction and subsequent heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Preliminary data further suggests that left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is linked to CMD via a mechanism of augmentation and/or perpetuation by cardiomyocyte fat accumulation. HFpEF is prevalent in women and older men, but poorly understood. Mechanistic understanding is critical to HFpEF intervention and guideline development.The study hypotheses are as follows:1. Risk factor conditions (hypertension, dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, loss of estrogen) promote an inflammatory and pro-oxidative state making the microvasculature vulnerable;2. Vulnerable coronary microvasculature becomes dysregulated (sympathetic nervous system activation, endothelial dysfunction, changes in vascular smooth muscle activation, spasm) causing repeated episodes of transient ischemia;3. Repeated ischemia-reperfusion episodes facilitate preconditioning with preservation of cardiomyocyte contractile and microvascular function against ischemic injury;4. Ischemia-reperfusion and preconditioning lead to cardiomyocyte fat accumulation and relaxation impairment resulting in diastolic dysfunction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).",NO,Microvascular Coronary Dysfunction|Cardiovascular Disease,PROCEDURE: Coronary Angiography|PROCEDURE: Coronary Reactivity Testing|PROCEDURE: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging|PROCEDURE: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Angiography|PROCEDURE: Computed Coronary Tomographic Angiography|PROCEDURE: Rest-Stress Millar Testing|PROCEDURE: Aortic vasorelaxation tests,"Cardiovascular (CV) events, up to 30 years","Persistent Chest Pain Symptoms: SAQ, Detailed information on chest pain symptoms will include the traditional angina questionnaire.

ZEN003694 is a protein inhibitor that binds to BET proteins. When ZEN003694 binds to BET proteins, it disrupts gene expression. Preventing the expression of certain growth-promoting genes may inhibit proliferation of tumor cells that over-express BET proteins. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Encorafenib is an enzyme inhibitor. It inhibits pathways that are responsible for controlling cell proliferation and survival, which may lead to a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. Both cetuximab and encorafenib have been approved to treat cancer. Adding ZEN003694 to cetuximab and encorafenib may be more effective at treating patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer than giving the usual treatment (cetuximab and encorafenib) alone.",NO,Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma|Recurrent Colorectal Adenocarcinoma|Refractory Colorectal Adenocarcinoma|Stage IV Colorectal Cancer AJCC v8,DRUG: BET Bromodomain Inhibitor ZEN-3694|PROCEDURE: Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|BIOLOGICAL: Cetuximab|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|PROCEDURE: Echocardiography|DRUG: Encorafenib|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|PROCEDURE: Multigated Acquisition Scan,"Maximum tolerated dose (dose escalation cohort), Will be determined based on the number of grade 3 or 4 adverse events in patients who participate on the study.

Migraine is extremely common and disabling in children. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safe and effective ubrogepant is in the acute treatment of migraine in children and adolescents.Ubrogepant is a drug approved for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. Children and adolescents (aged 6-17 years) with a history of migraine will be enrolled. The study will include 2 cohorts of participants - PK Cohort and Main Study (non-PK cohort). Participants aged 6-11 years in the PK Cohort will receive Dose A or Dose B of Ubrogepant for PK analysis to determine dose selection for the main study. In the main study, after dose selection, children aged 6-11 years will be randomized to receive either low or high dose of Ubrogepant or placebo. There is a 1 in 3 chance that a participant will be assigned to placebo. Adolescents aged 12-17 years will be randomized to receive either low or high dose of Ubrogepant or placebo with a 1 in 3 chance of placebo assignment.For qualifying migraine attacks, participants will receive oral tablets of the double-blind study intervention. There will be an option to take a second dose of double-blind study intervention (identical to initial dose), or rescue medication, at least 2 hours after the initial dose, for headache of moderate/severe intensity. Around 1059 participants will be enrolled in the study in approximately 120 sites in the United States. The study duration will be up to 6 months.There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care.

NCT01917721,Doxycycline Treatment to Prevent Progressive Coronary Artery Dilation in Children With Kawasaki Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01917721,UNKNOWN,"Kawasaki disease (KD) affects infants and young children causing inflammation of the skin and blood vessels including the coronary arteries of the heart. Despite the currently available therapy, about one third of children develop enlargement of the coronary arteries that can lead to serious complications such as coronary artery stenosis, heart attack and even death.Kawasaki disease is the most common heart disease in children in the USA and it is especially common among the children of Hawaii. Every year, 50-90 children are diagnosed with KD in Hawaii and unfortunately there is no medication available to successfully prevent coronary artery damage in a subset of cases.During the first few weeks of the illness, cells of the immune system attack the coronary arteries and release a special substance (MMP) that is responsible for the coronary artery enlargement. There is a common antibiotic, doxycycline that can specifically block the action of this special substance (MMP). Research done on animals with KD showed that doxycycline was able to block this special substance and prevent enlargement of coronary arteries. Research in adults with enlargement of the main artery in their abdomen also showed that doxycycline may improve the outcome. Based on these studies doxycycline may be a promising therapy for children with KD, who develop enlargement of the coronary arteries.The investigators' proposed research study will assess the usefulness of doxycycline in preventing the progressive enlargement of coronary arteries in children with KD. The investigators plan to perform a small (pilot) study to evaluate how good is doxycycline in preventing coronary artery enlargement.

NCT05235464,High Protein Diet and Atherosclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05235464,RECRUITING,"Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of the majority of cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction and strokes, and results in tremendous morbidity and mortality. A Western-type diet is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis because of the high saturated fat, cholesterol, and refined carbohydrate contents. Dietary strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease burden therefore focus on restriction of saturated fat, cholesterol, and refined carbohydrates whereas ""lean"" protein intake is recommended and has become popular. However, results from studies conducted in animal models suggest high dietary protein intake is also atherogenic. The investigators' extensive preliminary data in animal models show that dietary protein increases atherosclerotic plaque formation and size and promotes necrotic core formation, a characteristic of rupture-prone plaques. The goal of the current proposal is to provide deeper insights into the relationship between protein intake and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by studying the mechanisms involved in protein-mediated atherogenesis and formation of necrotic plaques. The overarching hypothesis is that high protein intake drives atherosclerosis via leucine-mediated mTORC1 signaling in macrophages, which inhibits macrophage mitophagy and aggrephagy and stimulates macrophage proliferation. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that proteins from animal sources are more atherogenic than proteins from plant sources, because animal proteins contain more leucine than plant proteins. The investigators will test these hypotheses by using a sophisticated array of experimental strategies, including assays in primary macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages and genetically engineered mouse models. In addition, they will begin to translate the results obtained in vitro and in animals to people, and explore approaches to pharmacologically target the pro-atherogenic pathways as novel cardiovascular therapeutics. This proposal represents a paradigm shift in how a Western-type diet affects vascular health which has important implications since many adults in Western societies consume excess protein and dietary protein is heavily marketed for its presumed beneficial health effects.",NO,Atherosclerosis,OTHER: Standard meal|OTHER: High animal protein meal|OTHER: High plant protein meal|OTHER: High plant protein meal with additional leucine,"Monocyte p-S6 content, phospho-S6 content in monocytes, change from at 1 hour before meal intake and 3 hours after the meal",,,University of Missouri-Columbia,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,24,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: OTHER",2097342,2023-03-13,2026-03-31,2027-03-31,2022-02-11,,2024-03-15,"University of Missouri School of Medicine, Columbia, Missouri, 65212, United States",
NCT06217302,Sotagliflozin to Slow Kidney Function Decline in Persons with Type 1 Diabetes and Diabetic Kidney Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06217302,RECRUITING,"Powerful new drugs that can prevent or delay end stage kidney disease (ESKD) - so called sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) - are now available for patients with type 2 diabetes. Whether these drugs have similar effects in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains unknown because of the few studies in this population, due to concerns about the increase in risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA, a serious, potentially fatal acute complication of diabetes due to the accumulation of substances called ketone bodies) observed with SGLT2i therapy in T1D. One of the few T1D studies conducted to date showed that implementing an enhanced DKA prevention plan can reduce the risk of DKA associated with the SGLT2i sotagliflozin (SOTA) to very low levels. In the present study, a similar DKA prevention program will be used to carry-out a 3-year trial to test the kidney benefit of SOTA in 150 persons with T1D and moderate to advanced DKD. After a 2-month period, during which diabetes care will be standardized and education on monitoring and minimizing DKA implemented, eligible study subjects will be randomly assigned (50/50) to take one tablet of SOTA (200 mg) or a similarly looking inactive tablet (placebo) every day for 3 years followed by 2-months without treatment. Neither the participants nor the study staff will know whether a person was assigned to taking SOTA or the inactive tablet. Kidney function at the end of the study will be compared between the two treatment groups to see whether SOTA prevented kidney function loss in those treated with this drug as compared to those who took the inactive tablet. The DKA prevention program will include participant education, close follow-up with study staff, continuous glucose monitoring, and systematic ketone body self-monitoring with a meter provided by the study. If successful, this study will provide efficacy and safety data that could be used to seek FDA approval of SOTA for the prevention of kidney function decline in patients with T1D and DKD.",NO,"Diabetic Nephropathies|Kidney Failure, Chronic|Diabetes Mellitus Type 1|Heart Failure",DRUG: Sotagliflozin|DRUG: Placebo,"eGFR at the end of the wash-out period following the treatment period, eGFR at the end of the 8-week drug washout period following the 3-year treatment period, estimated from Central Lab serum creatinine and cystatin C using the 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation and adjusted by its baseline value.

Starting treatment with the venetoclax and obinutuzumab early (before patients have symptoms) may have better outcomes for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma compared to starting treatment with the venetoclax and obinutuzumab after patients show symptoms.",NO,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma,PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Aspiration|PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|BIOLOGICAL: Obinutuzumab|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|DRUG: Venetoclax,"Overall survival, The final analysis will use stratified Cox proportional hazards regression stratified by Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia \[CLL\] International Prognostic Indicator \[CLL-IPI\] Risk score status (high risk versus very high risk) with a two-sided alpha of 0.042.

NCT04767984,Testing Atorvastatin to Lower Colon Cancer Risk in Longstanding Ulcerative Colitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04767984,RECRUITING,"This phase II trial studies the effect of atorvastatin in treating patients with ulcerative colitis who have a dominant-negative missense P53 mutation and are at risk of developing large intestinal cancer. Patients with ulcerative colitis are known to have an increased risk of developing large intestinal cancer. Better ways to control ulcerative colitis and more knowledge about how to prevent colon cancer are needed. Atorvastatin is a drug used to lower the amount of cholesterol in the blood and to prevent stroke, heart attack, and angina (chest pain). It blocks an enzyme that helps make cholesterol in the body. It also causes an increase in the breakdown of cholesterol. The information gained from this study may help doctors learn more about atorvastatin as an agent in cancer prevention, and may help to improve public health.",NO,Colorectal Carcinoma|Ulcerative Colitis,DRUG: Atorvastatin Calcium|PROCEDURE: Biopsy of Colon|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|DRUG: Placebo Administration|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration,"Reduction in mutant p53 staining in biopsy samples obtained during colonoscopies done before and after intervention, Counted as p53 positive cells/100 epithelial cells under at least 5 high powered fields per slide or 100 crypts or 2000 cells/slide per biopsy, measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. The level of biomarker expression will be determined by chromogenic staining. Because multiple samples will be obtained per participant, participant-level %p53 mutation will be summarized as the average %p53 across these samples. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize changes in each arm, as well as the difference in change between arms. Analysis will be conducted using a two-sample t-test comparing within-subject changes in average percentage (%) p53 between treatment arms. A more comprehensive analysis will be done using a linear mixed effects model, where the outcome variable will be %p53 staining in each sample evaluated at baseline and post-treatment., Up to 2 years","Levels of biomarkers of Ki-67 (cell proliferation), Waf1p21 (wild type p53 allele reactivated signal), and cleaved caspase-3 (wild type p53-induced cell apoptosis), Using IHC approach for colorectal biopsy specimens., Up to 2 years|Analysis of spectrum, hotspot and load of TP53 gene mutations, Using next generation sequencing and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technologies. The spectrum of TP53 mutations will be analyzed for frequency of each hotspot mutation in each group. For analyzing binary variables (presence or absence of each hot spot mutation), a Pearson's chi-squared test will be used. Frequency of each hotspot mutation for each noted group will be provided as descriptive measures of location and variance. The load of TP53 mutations in the biopsy specimens will be quantified as the ratio of mutant allele to wild-type allele using droplet digital PCR and allele-specific primers. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize these at each time point for each treatment arm. Changes in TP53 mutation load, a continuous biomarker, will be compared between treatment arms using similar approaches as the primary analysis of %TP53 described above., Up to 2 years|Histological analysis for grading the severity of histologic inflammation in colorectal biopsies, Using the Geboes grading system (grading score: 0 - 4).

People can take part if they have cardiovascular or chronic kidney disease. People who have at least 2 health problems related to their weight or risks of cardiovascular disease can participate. Participants must have previously tried to lose weight by changing their diet.The purpose of this study is to find out whether people with overweight or obesity who take a medicine called survodutide (BI 456906) are less or more likely to develop serious cardiovascular problems. It also aims to find out whether health parameters like blood pressure improve. Overweight and obesity are linked to cardiovascular disease. Survodutide is a medicine that is developed to help people with obesity or overweight to lose weight.Participants are divided into 3 groups of almost equal size. 2 groups get different doses of survodutide and 1 group gets placebo. Placebo looks like survodutide but does not contain any medicine. Every participant has a 2 in 3 chance of getting survodutide. Participants inject survodutide or placebo under the skin once a week. All participants also receive counselling on diet and physical activity.Participants are in the study for up to 2 years and 3 months.

NCT05561556,Mitochondria Oxidative Stress and Vascular Health Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05561556,RECRUITING,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death in America and most of the post-industrial world. Hypertension is a leading risk factor for CVDs including stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Black Americans suffer from the highest rates of hypertension of any racial/ethnic group in America, among the highest in the world. There are also well-documented racial disparities in vascular dysfunction (e.g., endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffening). Thus, racial disparities in hypertension and vascular dysfunction exacerbate the burden of CVDs, with Black Americans being 30% more likely to die from CVD than any other race in the US. It is established that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to vascular dysfunction. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding whether targeting mitochondrial dysfunction attenuates oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, and CVD risk among Black adults at heightened CVD risk. Thus, the investigators will conduct an 8-week trial with the mitochondrial antioxidant MitoQ in middle-aged and older Black and non-Black adults. Our overarching hypothesis is that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to heightened oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, and higher BP in Black adults; and that MitoQ will attenuate these racial differences. Importantly, the investigators will also assess social determinants of health (e.g., income, neighborhood disadvantage, discrimination) and health behaviors (e.g., diet, physical activity) and uncover their role in oxidative stress, vascular function, and BP Regarding methodology, the investigators will perform blood draws, vascular testing, preceding and following an 8-week, 20mg daily consumption of MitoQ and placebo.

The therapy used in this study is T Cell Receptor (TCR) Gene Therapy Targeting KK-LC-1, a cancer germline antigen that is expressed by certain cancers. This therapy is a type of treatment in which a participant s T cells (a type of immune system white blood cell) are changed in the laboratory to attack cancer cells and given back to the participant. This treatment might help people with KK-LC-1 positive cancers which may include gastric, breast, cervical, lung and other epithelial Cancers. Epithelial cancers are cancers that begin in the cells that line an organ.Objective:The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of different doses of KK-LC-1 TCR T cells plus aldesleukin to treat metastatic or refractory/recurrent KK-LC-1 positive cancers.Eligibility:Adults aged 18 and older with metastatic or refractory/recurrent KK-LC-1 positive epithelial cancer.Design:Participants will be screened with HLA typing (a blood test needed for eligibility) and KK-LC-1 testing of the cancer tumor (to determine if the cancer is KK-LC-1 positive). A new biopsy may be needed if tumor from an outside location is not available for KK-LC-1 testing. Eligible participants will come to the NIH campus to have a screening evaluation which will include physical exam, review of medical history and current medications, blood and heart tests, imaging (X-ray, CT scan, MRI or PET scan), and evaluation of participant s veins that are used for drawing blood.If the participant is eligible for the study based on the screening evaluation, they will have a baseline evaluation prior to receiving the experimental treatment which may include additional laboratory or imaging tests.Participants will have a large IV catheter inserted into a vein to undergo a procedure called leukapheresis. Leukapheresis is the removal of the blood by a machine to collect specific white blood cells. The remaining blood is returned to the body. This procedure is needed to collect the cells that will be modified to target the cancer. The cells are grown in the lab and given back to the participant through an injection into the participant's tumor. It takes 11-15 days to grow the cells.While the cells are growing, the participant will be admitted to the hospital about one weekbefore the cell infusion to receive 2 types of chemotherapy through an IV catheter over 5 days. The main purpose of the chemotherapy is to make the cells more effective in fighting the cancer tumors. The cells will be given 1-2 days after the last dose of chemotherapy. Within 24 hours after the cell infusion, participants will be given a cell growth factor called aldesleukin through an IV for up to 4 days. Aldesleukin is thought to help the cells live longer in the participant s body. Participants will recover in the hospital until they are well enough to go home, which is usually about 7-12 days after the cell infusion or last dose of aldesleukin.Participants will have a follow-up visit at approximately 40 days after the date of cell infusion. This visit will be to evaluate the safety of the cell therapy and the response of the cancer to the treatment which will include physical examination, lab tests, and imaging studies. If a participant has stable disease or their cancer has responded to the treatment, they will be seen again at 12 weeks post cell infusion, every 3 months x 3 visits, and then every 6 months x 5 years. If a participant s cancer progresses after this therapy, they will be return to their home doctor for further management.After receiving cell therapy, participants will be followed on a long-term gene therapy protocol. Participants will have blood drawn periodically to test if the cells have grown or changed. These blood tests will take place immediately before the cells, and then at 3, 6, and 12 months for the first year and possibly annually thereafter based on the results.

An important contributing factor for insufficient blood pressure control is non-adherence to antihypertensive medications. Research on medication adherence for PWH has largely focused on antiretroviral therapy adherence with limited focus on adherence to other non-AIDS condition medications.With a large proportion of PWH in the U.S. achieving viral suppression, providers may now have an opportunity to focus on the management of non-AIDS conditions like hypertension. However, because PWH who have achieved suppression have reduced clinic encounters (once or twice a year) there is potential loss of opportunity to effectively monitor and intensify hypertension treatment as needed an important opportunity to focus on preventing cardiovascular disease. CVD and other non-AIDS comorbidities.The study's overarching goal is to improve the hypertension outcomes for PWH on suppressive ART to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

NCT06443151,Role of Endothelial Function in SCI CVD Risk,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06443151,RECRUITING,"Individuals with spinal cord injury have heart attacks and strokes more frequently, and much earlier in life. People with spinal cord injuries develop plaque in vessels much faster, and the reasons why are unclear. Doctors generally attributed the increased risk with weight gain and developing diabetes, but many studies have shown that even without these common factors, plaque in vessels is developing more often and faster. Endothelial cells are a single layer of cells that line all vessels in the body and plays an important role in vessel health. Damage to endothelial cells is known to lead to heart attacks and strokes. Past studies on endothelial cells of people with spinal cord injury have been unclear. The investigators have new data that these cells are unhealthy after spinal cord injury a measurement. This includes measuring endothelial health by directly altering its function using a catheter in the arm and measuring small particles in blood called endothelial microvesicles. If the project is successful, the investigators will learn important information on the health of endothelial cells after spinal cord injury.

Granulomatous myocarditis can lead to ventricular dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias causing significant morbidity and mortality. Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) has been shown to reverse active myocarditis and preserve left ventricular (LV) function and in some cases improve LV function. In addition, IST can suppress arrhythmias that develop due to active myocarditis and prevent the formation of scar.The potential role of cardiac biomarkers, including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and cardiac troponins, in detecting active myocarditis is limited and studies have been disappointing. At present, there are no biomarkers to detect active myocarditis and the use of advanced imaging modalities (FDG-PET) for assessing and monitoring active myocarditis is not feasible or practical and is associate with high radiation exposure. As such, a biomarker that is reflective of active myocarditis and that is cardiac specific will assist physicians in assessing the presence of active myocarditis to guide therapeutic decisions and to assess response to therapy which can limit further cardiac damage.Cell free DNA (cfDNA) are fragments of genomic DNA that are released into the circulation from dying or damaged cells. It is a powerful diagnostic tool in cancer, transplant rejection and fetal medicine especially when the genomic source differs from the host.

NCT06271577,Smartphone Twelve-Lead ECG Utility In ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction II,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06271577,RECRUITING,"AliveCor (www.alivecor.com) has developed several electrocardiogram (ECG) devices that interface with iOS and Android smartphones and tablets via various Kardia apps. The current Kardia family of devices can measure single lead and six limb-lead ECGs, depending on the device. KardiaMobile, KardiaMobile 6L, and KardiaMobile Card have FDA clearance for ECG rhythm recording. A modified single-lead Kardia smartphone 12-lead ECG was previously validated in the multicenter ST LEUIS study for the diagnosis of ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) and Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI).Recently, AliveCor developed a new device: AliveCor (AC) 12-lead (12L) ECG System to record simultaneously 4 leads of ECG and then generate complete 12-lead ECGs. A previous protocol at the University of Oklahoma involved 200 subjects with early prototypes of the AC 12L device with the specific aim to validate that it accurately generated 12-lead ECGs as compared to simultaneously acquired FDA-cleared 12-lead ECGs. The prototype version of the AliveCor 12L ECG System simultaneously measured four channels of ECG (leads I, II, V2, V4), calculated the remaining limb leads as is standard for 12-lead ECGs (Leads III, aVR, aVL, aVF) and synthesized the remaining 4 precordial ECG leads (V1, V3, V5, V6). This protocol will serve to validate the production version of the system against standard 12-Lead ECGs for the diagnosis of STEMI and NSTEMI in patients admitted to the Emergency Department or directly to the Cardiac Cath Lab for the evaluation of chest pain. It is anticipated that the waveforms for each of the 12 leads from the AC 12L ECG System will be highly correlated with the corresponding leads from the comparator commercially available 12-lead ECG devices used at participating sites. The purpose of this study is to clinically validate that the four-channel AC 12L ECG device can enable the diagnosis of STEMI and NSTEMI in a non-inferior manner to existing 12-lead ECG devices.",NO,Myocardial Infarction|Ischemia|Myocardial Ischemia|Heart Diseases|Cardiovascular Diseases|Vascular Diseases|Heart Attack|Heart Failure,DEVICE: AliveCor 12-lead ECG,"Inter-rater variability for Standard 12-lead ECG readings, 30 seconds|Inter-rater variability for AC 12L ECG readings, 30 seconds|Number of standard 12-lead ECG readings requiring a consensus consultation, 30 seconds|Number of AC 12L ECG readings requiring a consensus consultation, 30 seconds|Sensitivity of AC 12L ECGs requiring consensus consultation, compared to standard 12-lead ECG requiring consensus consultation, for the diagnosis of STEMI, 30 seconds|Specificity of AC 12L ECGs requiring consensus consultation, compared to standard 12-lead ECG requiring consensus consultation, for the diagnosis of STEMI, 30 seconds|Positive predictive value of AC 12L ECGs requiring consensus consultation, compared to standard 12-lead ECG requiring consensus consultation, for the diagnosis of STEMI, 30 seconds|Negative predictive power of the AC 12L ECGs requiring consensus consultation, compared to standard 12-lead ECG requiring consensus consultation, for the diagnosis of STEMI, 30 seconds|Mean subjective correlation score for AC 12L ECGs in which the standard 12-lead ECG diagnosis is STEMI, 30 seconds|Mean subjective correlation score for AC 12L ECGs in which the standard 12-lead ECG diagnosis is not STEMI, 30 seconds|Mean summative ST-segment elevation, summative ST-segment depression and summative ST-segment deviation for AC 12L ECGs compared to standard 12-lead ECGs, 30 seconds",,,AliveCor,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,1000,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,PRO-0013,2024-03-12,2024-11,2024-12,2024-02-22,,2024-07-05,"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|Intermountain Health, Murray, Utah, 84107, United States",

Elucidate the influence of intense light therapy pretreatment in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We hypothesize that intense light exposure is associated with the peripheral stabilization of Per2 in human buccal swabs and plasma samples before surgery and with a decrease of Troponin I levels after surgery. In addition, we hypothesize that light therapy leads to Per2 dependent metabolic optimization in the human cardiac tissue. Therefore, a small piece of human heart tissue from the right atrium will be collected during cardiac cannulation, which will be otherwise discarded.2. Critical illness (being in the intensive care unit) results in circadian malfunction and vessels not working. Vessel function is controlled by the body's circadian clock. Intense light boosts the circadian clock and the vessel function in animal studies. Vessels not working well in critical ill patients results in a myriad of severe diseases (delirium, stroke, heart attack, organ damage etc).

NCT06544642,A Study to Evaluate the Effects of ASP5502 in Healthy Adults and Adults With Primary Sjögren's Syndrome,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06544642,RECRUITING,"Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a condition when the body's immune system attacks glands that produce fluids, such as the tear and saliva glands. This leads to dry eyes and a dry mouth. However, other symptoms may occur such as fatigue, joint pain, and skin problems. These symptoms can be severe. Symptoms can be treated but there is an unmet need to treat the actual condition.In this study, ASP5502 is being given to humans for the first time. The people taking part are healthy adults or adults with pSS. The main aims of the study are to check the safety of ASP5502 and how people tolerate ASP5502.This study will be in 3 parts. In Part 1, healthy men and women will take tablets of ASP5502 or a placebo just once. In this study, the placebo looks like the ASP5502 tablet but doesn't have any medicine in it. Different small groups of people will take a lower to a higher dose of ASP5502 or a placebo. This will happen one group after another. One small group will take tablets of ASP5502 or placebo with and without food. This is to find out if food affects how the body processes ASP5502.After their dose, people will stay in the medical center for a few nights. This is to have blood tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs) to check heart health, and other safety checks, and to report any medical problems. One of these checks is to have their heart continuously tracked during the first night. This is called telemetry. People who take tablets of ASP5502 or placebo with and without food will stay in the medical center for a few extra nights.In Part 2, healthy men and women will take tablets of ASP5502 or a placebo. They will do this once a day for 2 weeks (14 days). Different small groups of people will take a lower to a higher dose of ASP5502 or a placebo. This will happen one group after another.After taking ASP5502 or the placebo, people will stay in the medical center for a few nights. This is to have blood tests, ECGs to check heart health, and other safety checks, and to report any medical problems. Telemetry will also be done continuously during the first night.In Part 3, men and women with pSS will take tablets of ASP5502. They will do this once a day for 4 weeks (28 days). Different small groups of people will take a lower to a higher dose of ASP5502. This will either happen for one group after another, or just for 1 group. The number of groups and the doses taken will be worked out from the results from Part 1 and Part 2 of this study. People will stay in the medical center for a couple of nights. This will happen for their first dose, then again after about 2 weeks and 4 weeks of treatment. As in Parts 1 and 2, this is to have blood tests, ECGs to check heart health, and other safety checks, and to report any medical problems.In all parts of the study, people will return to the medical center about 1 week after their final blood sample is taken, for health check.

The main questions it aims to answer are:1. Whether initiation of BiPAP at the same time as continuous beta-agonist therapy (e.g., nebulized albuterol) will decrease how long children with moderate to severe asthma attacks need to receive continuous beta-agonist therapy.2. Whether early BiPAP changes how the lungs function in children with asthma attacks.3. Whether children receiving early BiPAP experience more issues or side effects than those children who do not.All children will receive the usual treatment for asthma attacks; if they are still experiencing moderate to severe symptoms after the initial treatment, they will be asked to participate in the study. Participants will then wear a mask while they are receiving the continuous beta-agonist therapy. Some patients will receive BiPAP where pressure is given to the lungs and others will have a sham BiPAP mask where no pressure is given to the lungs. Study participants will wear the mask for 4 hours or until their treatment team feels they are ready to come off of the continuous beta-agonist therapy. Participants will receive more medications and decisions on going home or being admitted to the hospital will be decided as usual by their treatment team.Researchers will compare BiPAP versus Control (Sham BiPAP) groups to see if there is a difference in how long continuous beta-agonist therapy is needed, how the lungs are functioning, and number or type of side effects.",NO,Asthma in Children,DEVICE: Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure|DEVICE: Sham Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure,"Duration of Continuous Beta-Agonist Therapy, Number of hours until discontinuation of continuous beta-agonist therapy, Through study completion, an average of 24 hours","Change in Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM), Change in Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) from baseline to two and four hours, minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 12, the higher the score the more severe the disease, At two and four hours after starting the intervention|Change in Respiratory Rate, Change in respiratory rate in breaths per minute from baseline to two and four hours, At two and four hours after starting the intervention|Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, Rate of participants requiring endotracheal intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation, Four-hour study intervention|Admission to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), Rate of admissions to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), Through entire hospitalization, an average of 72 hours|Total Length of Stay in Hospital, Total length of stay in hours in the Emergency Department (ED), Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), and hospital floor, Through entire hospitalization, an average of 72 hours|Hospital Readmissions, Rate of hospital readmission within 7 days, 7 days from hospital discharge date|Duration of Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP), Duration in hours of BiPAP administration, Through entire hospitalization, an average of 72 hours|Adverse Events, Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, sub-cutaneous emphysema, hypotension, vomiting, aspiration, skin breakdown, Four-hour study intervention|Change in Pulse Oxygen Saturation, Change in pulse oxygen saturation (range from 0 to 100%) from baseline to two and four hours, At 2 hour and 4 hours after starting the intervention|Change in Heart Rate, Change in heart rate in beats per minute from baseline to two and four hours, At 2 hour and 4 hours after starting the intervention",,"University of Colorado, Denver","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)",ALL,CHILD,NA,126,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",22-2338|1R61HL158814-01A1,2023-06-23,2026-12,2027-01,2023-05-08,,2024-10-04,"Childrens Hospital Colorado, Denver, Colorado, 80238, United States",

NCT05720156,Immunomodulatory Effects of PCSK9 Inhibition,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05720156,RECRUITING,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the leading cause of death worldwide. While medications, such as statins, significantly reduce atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk by lowering low density lipoprotein levels, they may also have pleiotropic effects on inflammation. The immunomodulatory effects of these medications are relevant to ASCVD risk reduction given that inflammation plays a central role in atherosclerotic plaque formation (atherogenesis) and influences the development of vulnerable plaque morphology. Patients on statins, however, may have residual inflammation contributing to incident ASCVD despite the potent LDL-lowering effects of statins. While new therapies, such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PSCK9) inhibitors, further reduce incident ASCVD and drastically reduce LDL-C below that achieved by statin therapy alone, PCSK9 inhibitors may also have pleiotropic effects on inflammation. Thus, PCSK9 inhibitors may help reduce arterial inflammation to a level closer to that of patients without ASCVD. This study will apply a novel targeted molecular imaging approach, technetium 99m (99mTc)-tilmanocept SPECT/CT, to determine if residual macrophage-specific arterial inflammation is present with statin therapy and the immunomodulatory effects of PSCK9 inhibition. Given the continued high mortality and morbidity attributable to ASCVD, strong imperatives exist to better understand the immunomodulatory effects of lipid lowering therapies and residual inflammatory risk. This understanding, in turn, will inform the development of new ASCVD preventative and treatment strategies as well as elucidate other indications for established therapies.",NO,"Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease|Cardiovascular Diseases|Atherosclerosis|Arterial Inflammation|Vascular Diseases|Vascular Disease, Peripheral|Vascular Calcification|High Cholesterol/Hyperlipidemia|Heart Diseases|Heart Attack|Stroke|Cerebrovascular Accident|Carotid Artery Diseases|Carotid Atherosclerosis|Transient Ischemic Attack",OTHER: 99mTc-tilmanocept SPECT/CT scanning,"Between-group difference (case participants versus control participants) in percent volume with aortic 99mTc-tilmanocept uptake across different uptake thresholds, Baseline|Change in the percent volume with aortic 99mTc-tilmanocept uptake across different uptake thresholds after PCSK9 inhibitor therapy for 12 months (case participants only), Baseline and 12 Months","Relationship between baseline immune cell subpopulations (cells/µL) and aortic volume with 99mTc-tilmanocept uptake, Baseline and 12 Months|Relationship between baseline markers of immune activation/ systemic inflammation and aortic volume with 99mTc-tilmanocept uptake, Baseline and 12 Months|Relationship between change in macrophage-specific arterial infiltration with PCSK9 inhibitors and change in immune cell subpopulations (cells/µL), Baseline and 12 Months|Relationship between change in macrophage-specific arterial infiltration with PCSK9 inhibitors and change in markers of immune activation/ systemic inflammation, Baseline and 12 Months|Relationship between change in macrophage-specific arterial infiltration with PCSK9 inhibitors and baseline immune cell subpopulations (cells/µL), Baseline and 12 Months|Relationship between change in macrophage-specific arterial infiltration with PCSK9 inhibitors and baseline markers of immune activation/ systemic inflammation, Baseline and 12 Months",,Massachusetts General Hospital,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,40,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2022P002214,2024-04-04,2026-03,2026-03,2023-02-09,,2024-05-10,"Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States",

The tests let doctors can see the amount of blood vessel narrowing and vessel wall thickness. This information may help diagnose and treat heart disease and other conditions that lead to heart attacks. Better MRI methods are needed to improve heart disease diagnosis, especially by avoiding the use of radiation. Researchers are testing new techniques to improve the quality of heart MRI, compared with more complex studies like catheterization or angiography.Objectives:- To compare heart MRI techniques with other tests used to diagnose heart disease.Eligibility:- People at least 18 years of age who either have or may have heart disease, or are healthy volunteers.Design:* Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood tests.* They will have an angiography to study the inside of blood vessels. This test is an x-ray study of the blood vessels. It will be done either separately or as part of a set of tests to diagnose possible heart disease.* Participants will have at least one and up to five MRI scans.

NCT04632485,Early Detection of Vascular Dysfunction Using Biomarkers From Lagrangian Carotid Strain Imaging,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04632485,RECRUITING,"The purpose of this research is assess imaging and identification of soft plaque that undergoes large deformations or strain will identify plaque vulnerable to rupture which could lead to 'silent strokes'. Validation of current study results with MRI will foster use of real-time ultrasound (US) strain imaging and strain indices as a screening tool for identifying normal human participants susceptible to increased vascular aging and developing plaque prone to rupture or micro-embolization.Current research will evaluate Lagrangian carotid strain imaging (LCSI) for prediction of vascular health on volunteers. In this study, investigators will evaluate age-related strain variations (due to plaque deposition) in the carotid artery, establishing groundwork that will help identify typical and atypical values for these indices. Investigator's hypothesis is that plaques with higher strain indices (softer plaques) are more prone to rupture than plaques with lower strain indices (stiffer) plaques, thus requiring intervention. Clinical criteria for treatment has focused primarily on the degree of stenosis. Long-term objectives are to provide non-invasive methods for screening participants at risk for vascular aging or plaque rupture in asymptomatic participants, expanding upon current criteria for risk assessments based on focal transient ischemic attack (TIA) or strokes. Variations in vessel strain have been associated with, or are precursors to, plaque deposition, vascular aging, or cerebrovascular diseases. Increased arterial strain and pressure changes have been linked to brain aging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based vascular indices, and memory deficits commonly linked to Alzheimer dementia. Stiffening and thickening of the arterial walls have also been associated with cerebrovascular disease. Investigators hypothesize that strain indices as vascular biomarkers can be utilized for screening possible 'vulnerable participants' validated with MRI, with the potential ability to improve endothelial function and reverse vascular aging. Strain indices may enable differentiating study participants with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) from other dementias.

NCT05343988,Percutaneous Neurostimulation to Treat Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity in Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05343988,RECRUITING,"Survivors of severe brain injury, such as lack of oxygen or severe traumatic brain injury, frequently experience Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity (PSH). PSH is characterized by disabling symptoms such as a fast heart rate, high blood pressure, rapid breathing, rigidity, tremors, and sweating due to uncontrolled sympathetic hyperactivity in the nervous system. Effective treatment is necessary to decrease secondary brain injury, prevent weight loss from increased metabolic demand and reduce suffering. Currently, a combination of medications to slow down the sympathetic nervous system, muscle relaxants, anti-anxiety drugs, gabapentin, and narcotics are used to treat PSH. The sudden, recurrent attacks of PSH often require repeated rescue medications and multiple drugs with a high risk of side effects. Non-drug treatments for PSH may revolutionize treatment. The novel and non-invasive Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Field Stimulation (PENFS) device is an attractive and potentially effective treatment option for PSH.PENFS, applied to the external ear, has been shown to be effective for conditions such as abdominal pain, narcotic withdrawal, and cyclic vomiting syndrome, all which have similar symptoms to PSH. Therefore, the hypothesis is PENFS could be effective in the treatment of PSH. The electrical current delivered by the PENFS device is thought to increase parasympathetic activity by stimulating a branch of the vagus nerve. PENFS was shown to decrease central sympathetic nervous system activity by 36% within 5 minutes of being placed in the ear of a rat model. Similar central inhibition could improve symptoms of PSH. This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility of performing an efficacy trial of PENFS for children with PSH.",NO,Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity,DEVICE: Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Field Stimulation (PENFS) device application,"The number of children enrolled (Ages 2-17) with acute severe brain injury (ASBI) and Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity (PSH) to use the Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Field Stimulation (PENFS) device for treatment, Number of patients enrolled, Up to 192 hours.|Study retention for those children enrolled with acute severe brain injury (ASBI) and Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity (PSH) to use the Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Field Stimulation (PENFS) device for treatment, Percentage of patients who complete the study, Up to 192 hours.|Device tolerability for those children enrolled with acute severe brain injury (ASBI) and Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity (PSH) to use the Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Field Stimulation (PENFS) device for treatment, Percentage of patients withdrawn due to device intolerability, Up to 192 hours.|Capturing at least 80 percent of scoring events to assess pediatric Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity (PSH) symptoms using the Clinical Feature Severity (CFS) scoring tool, The CFS will be administered by trained bedside nurses to capture PSH severity in enrolled patients before, during and after initiation of PENFS device treatment.

NCT01180361,Atherosclerosis in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Lupus: Restoring Cholesterol Balance,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01180361,RECRUITING,"Hypothesis: SLE and RA increase risk of myocardial infarction (MI, heart attack). Immune reactants in the circulation of SLE patients downregulate cholesterol efflux proteins 27-hydroxylase and ABCA1 and upregulate scavenger receptor CD36, thus encouraging cholesterol accumulation. Adenosine A2A receptor agonist or statin treatment of cells exposed to SLE plasma (or immune complexes or cytokine-enriched plasma fractions from SLE patients) may ameliorate inflammatory properties of their plasma, lessening its atherogenic potency.Rationale: SLE and RA plasma contain components not present in significant levels in normal plasma that could, individually or acting together, affect 27-hydroxylase, ABCA1 and CD36 expression. Candidate components include autoantibodies, immune complexes, and various cytokines. Statins reduce major cardiovascular events and death. Modulation of adenosine signaling participates in regulation of 27-hydroxylase and ABCA1. As a potential preventative and therapeutic approach to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the investigators evaluate the effect of A2A receptor agonists and statins on atherogenic parameters in SLE and RA plasma.Experimental Plan: Quantitate 27-hydroxylase and several other proteins involved in cellular cholesterol uptake and excretion in THP-1 monocytes/macrophages and HAEC after exposure to plasma and plasma components from SLE patients (and controls) ± lipid loading with acetylated LDL with/without addition of A2AR agonist, statin, or both.

NCT05989828,A2-ESO-1 TCR-Engineered T Cells for Relapsed/Refractory Advanced or Metastatic NY-ESO-1 Overexpression Positive Triple Negative Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05989828,RECRUITING,"This phase Ib trial tests the safety, side effects and best dose of anti-HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1 T-cell receptor (TCR)-transduced autologous T lymphocytes (A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells) in treating patients with NY-ESO-1 overexpression positive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed/recurrent) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory), and that may have spread from where it first started (primary site) to nearby tissue, lymph nodes (advanced) or to other places in the body (metastatic). NY-ESO-1 is an antigen found on the surface of many different types of tumor cells including TNBC. Antigens make it possible for immune cells to recognize and kill germ cells that invade the body, however, it is more difficult for immune cells to recognize antigens on tumor cells. T cells are a special type of immune cell in the blood. These T cells may be trained to recognize the NY-ESO-1 antigen on tumor cells, allowing the T cells to attack and kill those tumor cells. The A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells are T cells that have been removed from the patient's blood through a process called leukapheresis and then changed in the laboratory to recognize NY-ESO-1 on tumor cells. When given back to the patient, these A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells find and attack tumor cells that express NY-ESO-1. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. They are given before the T cells to support optimum activity of the A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells. IL-2 (aldesleukin) is in a class of drugs known as cytokines. It is a man-made version of a naturally occurring protein that stimulates the body to produce other chemicals which increase the body's ability to fight cancer. A2-ESO-1 TCR-T cells may kill more tumor cells in patients with recurrent or refractory advanced or metastatic TNBC that overexpresses NY-ESO-1.",NO,Triple Negative Breast Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: Aldesleukin|BIOLOGICAL: Anti-HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1 TCR-transduced Autologous T Lymphocytes|PROCEDURE: Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|PROCEDURE: Echocardiography|DRUG: Fludarabine|PROCEDURE: Leukapheresis|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|PROCEDURE: Mammogram|PROCEDURE: Multigated Acquisition Scan|PROCEDURE: Ultrasound Imaging,"Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of anti-HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1 T-cell receptor (TCR)-transduced autologous T lymphocytes (A2-ESO-1 TCR-engineered T cells), Will employ the Bayesian optimal interval to find the MTD., Up to 8 weeks after A2-ESO-1 TCR-engineered T cell infusion|Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities, Defined as any treatment-related death or any greater than or equal to grade 3 adverse event (AE) as assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0., Up to 8 weeks after A2 ESO-1 TCR-engineered T cell infusion","Antitumor activity, Antitumor activity will be assessed by RECIST 1.1.

While much of the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 has been attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or end-organ failure, emerging data suggest that disorders of coagulation, in particular hypercoagulability and venous thromboembolism (VTE), may represent an additional major, and possibly preventable, complication (Wu C, et al. JAMA Intern Med. 2020 Mar 13. \[Epub ahead of print\] and Tang N, et al. Thromb. Haemost. 2020 Feb 19. \[EPub Ahead of Print\]). Abnormal coagulation testing results, especially markedly elevated D-dimer and FDP, have been associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19 infection. We propose the following Electronic Health Record (EHR)-guided 10000-patient, retrospective observational cohort study to assess VTE incidence, risk factors, prevention and management patterns, and thrombotic outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection. In order to gain the valuable perspective of other regional and national centers providing care for large populations of COVID-19, we have started a collaborative network with 5 additional sites which will provide us with de-identified data from 1000 patients each.

This means that their levels of one or more types of blood cell, such as the red cells or platelets, are lower than they should be. This can occur because a person s immune system might attack these cells after a stem cell transplant. Cytopenia can lead to anemia, severe bleeding, infections, and other problems. Treatments are needed to help keep blood cell levels stable after blood stem cell transplant.Objective:To test a study drug (fostamatinib) in people who have cytopenia after a blood stem cell transplant.Eligibility:People aged 18 to 75 years who have cytopenia after a blood stem cell transplant.Design:Participants will be screened. They will have a physical exam. They will have blood, urine, and stool tests.Fostamatinib is an oral tablet taken by mouth. Participants will take the pills 2 times a day for 12 weeks.Participants will have a medical assessment every 2 weeks; their vital signs will be checked, and they will have blood and stool tests.

It is the leading cause of death in both men and women.Coronary artery disease (CAD) occurs when the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle (the coronary arteries) become hardened and narrowed. The arteries harden and narrow due to buildup of fatty and calcified material called plaque on their inner walls. The buildup of plaque is also called atherosclerosis. This is a process which starts early in life, but can be influenced by multiple factors.Several factors increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis. They include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol and being related to someone who had a heart attack or a stroke. The more risk factors you have, the greater the chance that you have severe atherosclerosis. Some of the risk factors cannot be modified, like age and family history of early heart disease. The influenceable factors include high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, high blood sugar, cigarette smoking, overweight or obesity, and lack of physical activity.Nevertheless, there are patients without any above mentioned risk factors who develop atherosclerosis. In addition to that, there are also patients with several risk factors who do not develop severe coronary artery disease.According to research studies high blood levels of some substances in the blood (biochemical markers) as well as some genes in the DNA of our cells may be associated with an increased risk of developing CAD and faster progression of the disease.The purpose of this study is to find a correlation between certain blood markers and growth of the plaques, regardless of the presence of the classic risk factors for atherosclerosis.

CAR T-cell therapy is a treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein, such as CD19, on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the huCD19 positive CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. huCD19-CAR T cell therapy may be safe, tolerable and effective in treating patients with relapsed or refractory CD19 positive ALL.",NO,Recurrent Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,PROCEDURE: Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Aspiration|PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Biopsy|BIOLOGICAL: CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/mem-enriched T-lymphocytes|BIOLOGICAL: Cetuximab|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|PROCEDURE: Echocardiography|DRUG: Fludarabine|PROCEDURE: Leukapheresis|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|PROCEDURE: Multigated Acquisition Scan|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography,"Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Toxicity/ adverse events will be graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0.

NCT04306445,"How Gas-Filled Intragastric Balloons or Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty Affect Hunger, Hunger Hormones, and Gastric Emptying Compared to Meal Replacements",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04306445,UNKNOWN,"The disease obesity continues to be a major health issue in the US with over one third of the population having a mass index \>30 kg/m2. Obesity is associated with serious cardiometabolic complications including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and myocardial infarction. Rates of successful obesity treatment with weight loss and weight maintenance remain low. Several endoscopic bariatric therapies and procedures have been approved for use in the United States, including three intragastric balloon systems (2 fluid-filled and one gas-filled) and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), both of which have lower risks than bariatric surgery and do not alter gastrointestinal anatomy. Weight loss with all intragastric balloons and ESG is higher than lifestyle therapy or weight loss medications, but less than bariatric surgery. Unlike weight loss medications where weight loss from the medication is regained within 6-8 months after therapy ends, weight loss maintenance with intragastric balloons remains high with 66-88.5% of the weight loss maintained 6 months after device removal. Data suggests that space occupying devices with a volume of 400 ml or more in the stomach increase feelings of fullness and result in weight loss, but this does not explain the prolonged effect of weight loss maintenance after balloon removal. Although few studies have investigated the mechanism of action of fluid-filled balloons and one study with 4 patients undergoing ESG on weight loss, these data suggest that gastric emptying as well as space occupation contribute to weight loss. However, no studies have investigated the mechanisms of action of gas filled intragastric balloons on weight loss.Understanding the mechanisms responsible for weight loss with the gas filled intragastric balloon system and ESG as well as any weight loss independent effects on blood glucose control would lay the groundwork for studies evaluating predictors of response to improve patient selection as well as studies understanding the mechanisms behind weight loss maintenance and developing strategies to prolong weight loss maintenance.Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study is to determine the effects 10% total body weight loss (%TBWL) in patients with obesity treated with the intragastric balloon (GF- IGB) system or ESG compared to patients with obesity treated with a meal replacement program (MRP) on 1) gastric emptying, 2) hormonal adaptation to weight loss and 3) hunger.",NO,Obesity,DEVICE: GF-IGB: Obalon Balloon|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Medically Supervised Meal Replacement Program: My New Weigh|PROCEDURE: Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty: (ESG),"Weight Loss, 10%TBWL by GI-IGB, ESG, or Medically Supervised MRP, 6 months","Gastric emptying measured by technetium 99 gastric emptying study, The investigators hypothesize that treatment with GF-IGB and ESG will result in greater gastric retention of contents at 2 hours compared with patients who are treated with MRP., 6 months|Acyl-Ghrelin measured at multiple times points during a mixed meal test (MMT), The investigators hypothesize that weight loss induced increase in active ghrelin concentrations seen during a mixed meal tolerance test will be lower in patients treated with GF- IGB and ESG compared with patients treated with MRP., 6 months|Glucose measured at multiple times points during a mixed meal test (MMT), There will be no difference in glucose concentrations in patients treated with GF-IGB and ESG compared with treatments treated with MRP., 6 months|Insulin measured at multiple times points during a mixed meal test (MMT), There will be no difference in insulin concentrations in patients treated with GF-IGB and ESG compared with treatments treated with MRP., 6 months|Level of hunger measured using a visual analog scale (Hunger VAS), The investigators hypothesize that hunger will increase before and during a MMT after weight loss with MRP but will not change from baseline after weight loss with GF-IGB and ESG treatment.

NCT04377997,Safety and Efficacy of Therapeutic Anticoagulation on Clinical Outcomes in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04377997,UNKNOWN,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused considerable morbidity and mortality in over 170 countries. Increasing age and burden of cardiovascular comorbidities are associated with a worse prognosis among patients with COVID-19. In addition, serologic markers of more severe disease including coagulation abnormalities and thrombocytopenia, are not uncommon among patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection and are more common in patients who died in-hospital. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, there is a pressing need to identify safe, effective, and widely available therapies that can be scaled and rapidly incorporated into clinical practice. Understanding the putative mechanism of increased mortality risk associated with abnormal coagulation function and cardiac injury is critical to guide studies of promising therapeutic interventions. Published and anecdotal reports indicate that endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis are common in critically ill patients with COVID-19, including reports of diffuse microvascular thrombosis in the lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys. Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD risk factors are known to have endothelial dysfunction and a heightened risk of thrombosis. A recent study of COVID-19 inpatients from Wuhan, China observed that an elevated D-dimer level greater than 1 ug/mL was associated with an 18 times higher risk of in-hospital death, underscoring the importance of increased coagulation activity as a potential modifiable risk marker that may drive end-organ injury. Given the established link between endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis in patients with cardiovascular disease, and the association between coagulopathy and adverse outcomes in patients with sepsis, the association between increased coagulation activity, end-organ injury, and mortality risk may represent a modifiable risk factor among COVID-19 patients with critical illness. Therefore, we propose to conduct a randomized, open-label trial of therapeutic anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients with an elevated D-dimer to evaluate the efficacy and safety.",NO,Cardiovascular Diseases|COVID-19,DRUG: Enoxaparin,"Number of patients with the composite efficacy endpoint of death, cardiac arrest, symptomatic deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, or hemodynamic shock., Aim 1 - Risk of death, cardiac arrest, symptomatic deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, or hemodynamic shock., 12 weeks|Number of patients with a major bleeding event according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definition., Aim 2 - Risk of major bleeding event according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definition., 12 weeks",,,Massachusetts General Hospital,Bristol-Myers Squibb,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,300,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2020P001136,2020-05-15,2022-06-01,2022-06-01,2020-05-07,,2022-02-22,"Abdurahman Khalil, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States",

NCT06522997,A Study to Learn About How Well BAY3283142 Works and Its Safety in Participants With Chronic Kidney Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06522997,RECRUITING,"Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD is a condition in which the kidneys' ability to work properly gradually decreases over time. A common sign of decreasing kidney function is the body losing too much of a protein called albumin in the urine. This condition is known as albuminuria. This can lead to a faster decline in kidney function. People who have high blood pressure and diabetes are more likely to have CKD and are at a higher risk of complications related to it.BAY3283142 is a new drug that is being developed to treat people with CKD. It works by activating a protein that helps relax blood vessels and is thought to have beneficial effects in CKD.In this study, researchers want to learn about how well different doses of BAY3283142 work when taken with standard treatment for CKD in reducing albumin in the urine of participants with CKD. They will compare the results of the change in the urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) after 16 weeks for BAY3283142 with a placebo. A placebo looks like the study drug but does not have any medicine in it.During the study, participants will take either of the following drugs:* BAY3283142: Participants will take BAY3283142 as tablets by mouth.* Placebo: Participants will take it in the same way as BAY3283142. Participants will continue taking the available standard treatment for CKD and other conditions they may have (for example, heart conditions and diabetes).At the start of this study, the researchers will check the medical history and current medications of the participants. They will also perform a complete health check-up of all the participants. Researchers will take urine and blood samples from the participants at different time points to measure UACR and eGFR.Participants will be divided equally into different groups. Only 1 group will receive placebo and the other groups will receive BAY3283142. Participants will take their assigned treatment for 16 weeks.No one will know who receives which drug or dose of BAY3283142 during the study.Participants will be in this study for around 23 weeks. This includes the time for screening before the start of treatment and follow-up with participants after treatment.People can join this study if they:* are 18 years of age or older and have been diagnosed with CKD* have poor kidney function according to the eGFR test* have abnormally high levels of albumin in the urine according to the UACR test* have been taking certain drugs at a stable dose for management of high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease, etc. for at least 4 weeks before the start of the studyPeople cannot join this study if they:* have low blood pressure* have had a stroke or a heart attack, or were hospitalized because of heart failure in the 3 months before the start of the study* have a serious liver disease* have a kidney disease for which they need to take drugs that control the immune system The detailed requirements will be discussed between the study doctors and people considering joining this study.Participants may or may not get the expected benefits of treatment with BAY3283142, but they will receive thorough medical check-ups during this study. These can help to improve individual treatment in the future and to identify unknown medical risks.Some participants may experience medical problems during this study including pain and discomfort when blood samples are taken. Researchers will closely monitor and manage any medical problems the participants may have. They will not include people who should not take BAY3283142 due to known safety concerns.The findings from this study may contribute to developing a new treatment option for people with CKD who have excess albumin in the urine.",NO,Chronic Kidney Disease,DRUG: BAY3283142|DRUG: Placebo,"Change from baseline to Week 16 in the logarithm of urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), From baseline to Week 16","Change from baseline over time in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), From baseline to Week 16|Change from baseline over time in the logarithm of UACR, From baseline to Week 16|Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study intervention, From the first dose of study intervention up to 7 days after last intake of study intervention, up to 17 Weeks per each participant",,Bayer,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,700,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",22040|2023-505755-40-00,2024-08-08,2026-05-15,2026-06-17,2024-07-26,,2025-01-10,"Nephrology Consultants, LLC, Huntsville, Alabama, 35805-4104, United States|California Institute of Renal Research - Chula Vista, Chula Vista, California, 91911, United States|Balboa Research SMO+ - La Mesa, La Mesa, California, 91942, United States|California Kidney Specialists (CKS) - San Dimas, San Dimas, California, 91773-3538, United States|Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, 06510, United States|Nova Clinical Research | Brandenton, FL, Bradenton, Florida, 34209, United States|Renstar Medical Research, Ocala, Florida, 34470, United States|Elixia Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, 32608, United States|Florida Institue for Clinical Research, Orlando, Florida, 32825, United States|Southeastern Clinical Research Institute, LLC, Augusta, Georgia, 30904, United States|Research by Design, LLC | Chicago, IL, Chicago, Illinois, 60643, United States|Nephrology Associates of Northern Illinois and Indiana (NANI) - Hinsdale, Hinsdale, Illinois, 60521, United States|Triad Internal Medicine, Asheboro, North Carolina, 27203-5573, United States|Eastern Nephrology Associates - New Bern, New Bern, North Carolina, 28562, United States|Brookview Hills Research Associates, LLC, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27103, United States|Knoxville Kidney Center (KKC), PLLC, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923-3624, United States|Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, 37232, United States|Renal Disease Research Institute | Landry, Dallas, Texas, 75246, United States|Southwest Houston Research, Ltd., Houston, Texas, 77099, United States|Clinical Advancement Center, PLLC, San Antonio, Texas, 78212-4740, United States|DaVita Clinical Research | Westover Hills, San Antonio, TX, San Antonio, Texas, 78251, United States|DaVita Clinical Research | North Houston, TX, Shenandoah, Texas, 77384, United States|Utah Kidney Research Institute | Salt Lake City, UT, S.

The study will create a registry that will include entry of procedural and clinical follow-up information into an online data collection software, REDCAP.Data available since Jan 1 2005 will be included in the registry, until 14,000 patients have been included. The primary objectives of this observational registry study are to:1. Compare stent and non-stent based outcomes defined as a composite of symptom driven target vessel revascularization (TVR), unplanned surgical revascularization of the target limb and need for target limb amputation through 12 months post-index procedure (Primary efficacy endpoint)2. Compare stent and non-stent based outcomes defined as a composite of causes such as: death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, peri-procedural complications, target vessel revascularization (TVR) and unplanned surgical revascularization/amputation of the target limb through 12 months (Primary safety endpoint)3. Compare stent and non-stent based change in walking distance, Rutherford category and/or ankle- brachial index (ABI) at 12 months compared to baseline (Primary clinical improvement endpoint)Approximately 14,000patients will be enrolled at approximately 60 sites worldwide. Enrollment in the observational study will be monitored in an effort to achieve at least 20% (and no more than 80%) of the population receiving stents as the initial treatment strategy. Follow-up visits by sites will be reported at 6 and 12 months after index procedure to collect data on treatment patterns and effectiveness, and outcomes. The follow-up procedures are not mandated by the registry protocol. Each site will be encouraged to enter follow-up information derived from clinically indicated follow-up visits. All events post-index procedure till the 7th month will be reported under the 6 month follow-up form and subsequent follow-up till the 13th month post-procedure will be entered on the 12 month follow-up form.Patient management and treatment decisions are at the discretion of the care team per routine clinical practice. The procedural aspects (including selection of stent type or non-stent based treatments) and follow-up are not mandated by the registry and will be up to the discretion of the operator and/or based upon the practice dictated by the clinical care of the patient.
